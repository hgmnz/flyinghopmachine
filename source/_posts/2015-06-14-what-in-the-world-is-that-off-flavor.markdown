After a couple of years brewing I came across one of the biggest difficulties
in my brewing to date. A bold, in your face, undeniable off-flavor had plagued
my (home) brewhouse. The flavor was medicinal, plastic-like, pool-like and very
very overruling. I lost three 5 gallon batches of homebrew, and this is the
story of my quest to find out what was the cause.

<!--more-->

I had never had a such a *bad* batch before then, and by bad I mean bad
process, not bad recipe. I screwed up many a recipes before. The intensity in
this flavor got me chasing a ghost for a few months. During these period, I
brewed these beers:

1. Saison
2. Rye Smoked Porter
3. Rye IPA
4. Rye Smoked Porter (again)

In terms of brewing process, I made a few changes before this off-flavor
appeared in my beers: Use a yeast starter, wort aeration with an aquarium pump
and diffusion stone, and using yeast nutrients. These changes were correcting
high-gravity beers which were coming out under-attenuated.

I first noticed the flavor on the Saison and the Smoked Porter, both of which I
brewed close enough to each other that I didn't know they both had this
issue as they were fermenting.

I brewed the Rye IPA pretty much the day I found out about the off-flavor as
I racked them to kegs, and so I didn't really change anything about my
equipment or process for that brew. I was pretty much sending a batch of wort
to ferment, not knowing if it would have this flavor too. I went on
regardless.

## The quest begins

First off, for the Rye IPA batch, I sampled it at various points during the
brewing process and fermentation to try and determine where it was coming from.

Then I took the Saison and the Smoked Porter to my awesome LHBS. After tasting
it there I was convinced this was not an easy thing to fix. The advice I got
was to deep clean everything, and to replace racking canes or hoses that might
be suspect.

I chill my wort with a [plate
chiller](http://www.blichmannengineering.com/products/therminator), so the
output wort hose for this was suspect, as well as the chiller itself. I later
replaced this hose, as well as my racking cane which had some buildup. It turns
out you can't *really* clean racking canes well, it's good to replace these
every 6 - 12 months or so depending on how much you brew. I also got a hose
cleaning brush as I noticed some buildup in some hoses as well as in the
in-line [ThruMometer](http://www.blichmannengineering.com/products/thrumometer)

I also took the Saison and the Smoked Porter to my homebrew meetup, which
includes many experienced brewers as well as a BJCP judge. The obvious flavor
was there, everyone agreed, but nobody could tell me definitively where the
flavor came from. I got conflicting advice in that some folks assured me it
wasn't a bacterial or infection induced flavor as those tend to turn beer
acidic. So indeed, the plot thickens.

Next up, I kegged my Rye IPA, and I was surprised and relieved that it didn't
also have the off-flavor. This was one of those beers that went fast because it
was so darn delicious!

Confident in the fact that there was nothing wrong with my equipment at this
point, I went on to brew my Rye Smoked Porter again. At this point, I had
deep-cleaned all of my equipment, replaced suspect parts, and knew that it was
clean of any bacteria. After all, the previous brew went just fine.

This time around, I tried my wort/beer every step of the way, too. No signs of
this flavor on brewday, so pitched my starter yeast, and off to primary
fermentation it goes.

I sampled the fermenting beer 3 days in and it was clean. Five days in, same
thing. I'm safe, I thought. Let it ferment all the way, for about 14 days, and
to my surprise the flavor was back when I kegged.

I still carbonated it. Before I poured this batch down the drain, I saved a few
bottles to get more help identifying what's up. I gave a bottle to a local
friendly brewery, [Cleophus Quealy](http://www.cleoph.us/), who also asked me
for the recipe and brewing notes.

Brewing notes included the usual brewday notes, but most notably that I used my
local tap water, but removed chlorine with campden tablets and boiling
treatment, something that I've done successfuly in brews past.

Here's what they had to say:

{% blockquote %}
Strong antiseptic flavor. The phenols in the smoke are mixing crazy with possibly the chlorine in the water.  I would ditch the campden tables and go to carbon filtering. Pretty hard to diagnose with that strong off flavor. Biggest guess is chlorophenols esp with the smoked malts.
{% endblockquote %}

## ChloroWHAT?

Yeah, [chlorophenols](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlorophenol). These nasty
compounds are formed when phenols bond with chlorine. Phenol production is
evident in some malts and yeasts, notably smoked malts and some yeasts such as
the [WY3711](https://www.wyeastlab.com/rw_yeaststrain_detail.cfm?ID=199among)
used here among many others, but not really on
[WLP001](http://www.whitelabs.com/yeast/wlp001-california-ale-yeast) used for
the Rye IPA.

Alright, so this makes sense, but does this mean that campden tablets don't
work? No, it doesn't, and here's the last piece of the puzzle: I started
getting these off-flavors when I changed something about my brewing process,
and the key in the yeast starter. I was just using tap water with no filtration
or treatment to build my starters. Even though we're just talking less than a
couple of liters of water, this seams to fit the bill.

I've since switched to using RO or carbon-filtered water for my starters, and
haven't had a problem again, even after brewing the same recipes pressumably
containing the same phenol production.

## Lessons and Conclusions

* Do not mess with Chlorine. I still trust campden tablets, but carbon
  filtration, reverse osmosis, distillation, and boiling treatments are also
  effective.
* Beware of your yeast starter water! It can ruin a batch or three.
* Good cleaning and sanitation practices are crucial. I always thought I did a
  good job at this, but in the face of this issue I wasn't *sure* - there was
  always a chance I was messing something up. As a result, I am now even more
  thorough about cleaning and sanitation, and going forward an off-flavor will
  be less likely to be sanitation related and might lead me to finding the
  cause faster.
