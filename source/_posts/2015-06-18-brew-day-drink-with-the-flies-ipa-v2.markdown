I recently brewed an IPA using only New Zealand and Australian hop varieties. I
was shooting for a very light colored, clear, crisp, and fruity IPA to enjoy in
the summer. I used a very simple grain bill consisting of 50/50 domestic 2-row
and pilsener malts, and added a half pound of wheat to aid in head retention.

For hops, I used Waimea, Australian Summer and Nelson Saivan as follows:

* FWH: 1oz Waimea, 1oz Nelson Sauvin
* 30m: 1 oz Waimea
* 5m: 1oz Australian Summer, 1oz Waimea
* 0m: 1oz Nelson Sauvin 1oz Australian Summer
* Dry hop for 3 days: 1oz Waimea, 1oz Nelson Sauvin

I was also experimenting with large First Wort Hopping (FWH) additions while
avoiding any bittering additions at all. I was trying to see how much bittering
I could get from FWH alone. It may have been the hops used, or the process
itself, but I didn't really get much bittering from FWH, so that might be a
good technique for extracting a small amount of bittering from hops. It's hard
to tell how much of the flavor and aroma profile comes from FWH in this beer as
it had many other later hop additions.

In any case, it's an easy enough technique that I'll be including in more of my
brews going forward.

## Beer issues

The resulting beer was OK, but it had some issues that I will address in this
version:

### Color and mouth feel

It didn't have enough of a malt backbone, and honestly it fell a bit flat and
uninteresting. The color was super pale and yellow, which I was going for, but
I think it could use a bit more color.

To address this, I'm changing the grist by replacing some of the 2-row malt
with some Vienna and Munich malts to layer some complexity without adding any
significant sweetness, and adding I'm also adding a bit of dextrin to increase
body.

### Hop aroma

It could definitely use more hop aroma and bitterness. I'm now adding a proper
bittering addition with Centennial, one of my go-to bittering hops for it's
high alpha acid content and low cost. I'm also pushing more hops to the later
additions to get more flavor out of them, and throwing Galaxy into the mix
to get even more of a tropical and grapefruit aroma and flavor.

### Yeast selection

It could use a bit more ester production in fermentation, so I am switching
WLP001 with a bit more flavorful but dry strain, WLP007.

### Mash pH

My mash pH on the last brew was at 5.8 and I corrected it by adding some
phosphoric acid right in the mash cooler. While I have changed the grist, it's
still fairly, so this time around I'm increasing the calcium content in the
mash to help it reach a level closer to 5.3. Last time I used 1.5tsp gypsum and
1/4tsp calcium chloride in my strike water. I'll increase that to 2tsp of
gypsum and a 1/2tsp of calcium chloride this time around.

The final recipe looks like this:

5 lb American 2-row<br>
7 lb American pilsener<br>
2 lb Vienna<br>
8 oz Munich<br>
12oz Dextrin<br>
8oz Wheat Malt

FWH: 1oz Nelson Sauvin<br>
60m: 1z Centennial<br>
15m: 1 oz Waimea<br>
5m: 1oz Australian Summer, 1oz Galaxy<br>
0m: 1oz Nelson Sauvin, 1oz Waimea

WLP007 - Dry English Ale Yeast

Dry hop for 3 days:<br>
1 oz Waimea, 1 oz Galaxy
