This time around I'm looking to do a 100% Brettanomyces IPA. In fact, the first
100% Brett beer I brew, so this should be interesting.

<!--more-->

First things first: What flavors can be expected from a 100% Brettanomyces
fermentation? In reality, it's all sorts of flavors, except for neutral such
as with the Chico strain of brewer's yeast.

As with saccharomyces, brettanomyces is able to produce various esthers and
polyphenols. Different strains and species of brettanomyces are produce different
kinds of flavors. Brettanomyces is just a yeast after all, not a bacteria as is
often believed to be.

One of the exciting aspects of fermenting with Brett is that it is in fact a
wild yeast. As such it can take it's own course, and the brewer must be
somewhat on top of the flavors that it develops, paciently waiting for the right
time to drink. While I have no experience with brett fermentation yet, I expect the
flavor of this beer to change over time, and that's plain thrilling.

Brettanomyces can develop horsey, barnyard, fecal, sweaty, plastic flavors, as well as
pineapple, pear, stone fruit, sour and vinegar flavors.

While it is a wild yeast, I have chosen a known strain for this beer that should not be very heavy on the barnyard flavor and more forward with fruit. I hope this to be a very fruity IPA, with enough funk and dynamics to make it interesting. Whatever comes out, I'm up for the journey.

Because of the fruit aromas and flavors expected from the brett fermentation, I
chose to use hops that would accentuate and play well with that profile.
Amarillo is flowery and citrusy, and one of my favorite hops to use I may add.
To that I've added Galaxy for its passionfruit and again citrus character, and
finally chinook to layer in some spice and pine character along with it's
subtle grapefruit notes. My hope is I won't really be able to tell where the
brett starts and the hops continue - they should play together to create some
nice complexity unlike anything I've only ever read about, such as Crooked
Stave's 100% Brett Citra IPA. Finally, Brett beers' perceived bitterness is lower
than that of saccharomyces, so not only did I first wort hopped this beer, but I also
added a doze of high alpha acid Warrior at 60m.

When making a 100% Brett beer, I consider production of wort as a primary driver for creating the right medium for brett to do it's thing. First of all, Brett chews up all sorts of sugars, unlike saccharomyces. Further, brett does not produce any glycerol, which contribute to saccharomyces beers' mouth feel. To top that off, brett can dry beers way out, so we want to help it out on the mouth feel front. For that reason, I mashed at a higher-than-usual temperature, and I added fermentables that aid in mouth feel such as carapils.

Another important consideration for 100% Brett beers is that pitching rate is very high, and therefore it's required to build up a good starter. Brett is also slower in general than sacc, so building up the starter will require a bit more planning, and fermentation itself will take about twice as long. I plan on letting this ferment at least 4 weeks, if not more.

The resulting recipe is as follows:

*Fermentables*

## Brew notes

#### September 1, 2015

Created a starter with 300ml of 1.040 wort and one vial of WLP648. Kept starter
agitated on a stir plate.

This starter formed a pellicle, and lots of condensation in the flask in about 3 days.

#### September 5, 2015

Created a larger 1.8l starter and pitched 300ml on it. During the transfer, I
did not notice any acetic acid/vinager aroma which is great.

Left starter on stir plate.

#### September 6, 2015

Moved starter off of stir plate and placed in fermentation chamber (ahem,
closet). Left it there until brew day.

#### September 12, 2015.

A few hours before pitching, I moved the starter to the stir plate again. There
wasn't a large pellicle to speak of, but there was plenty of activity and
CO<sub>2</sub> production.

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hgmnz/20783871243/in/album-72157655784368350/" title="Untitled"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/696/20783871243_bc542b5a1d_z.jpg" width="640" height="640" alt="Untitled"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

I started this brew with RO water. Initial water pH was 5.7, which required no
further acidification nor other salt treatments as this water has very low
alkalinity.

I heated strike water to 174F, and doughed-in, resulting in a mash temperature
of 156F.

Mash pH was 5.4.

Sparged for about 55 minutes and collected 7.5 gallons of wort.

Added 1 tsp of gypsum and 1/4 tsp of Calcium Chloride to kettle for flavor.

Added boil additions per recipe.

Cold-crashed with a plate chiller, and moved wort to fermenter.

Aerated and pitched entire starter. OG was 1.060.

#### September 14, 2015

First signs of activity in fermentation. Creamypellicle starting to form.
