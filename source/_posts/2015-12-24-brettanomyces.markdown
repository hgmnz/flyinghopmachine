Brettanomyces provides flavors often associated with funky barnyard or horse
blanket, but this little organism is so much more and can be used to impart a
variety of flavors ranging from tropical and fruity to spicy to cheesy to
funky, and while it's considered wild, there's a lot a brewer can do to favor
or accentuate some flavor over another.

One of the first misconceptions about brettanomyces is that it's a bacteria,
which is false. Brettanomyces is a yeast just like saccharomyces. It is
considered to be wild yeast though, even though it's been tamed these days can
be purchased from many commercial labs.

As compared to saccharomyces, it does have a few characteristics that
differentiate the two. While sacc might begin active fermentation in a few
hours, brettanomyces is much slower to start. In my own brewing I've seen a lag
time of over 48 hours for 100% brett beers. It also works slower than sacc, so
forget about a ten day fermentation like what can be done with some sacc
strains. Instead expect many weeks to months for brett to go through it's
phases.

Brett requires a higher pitching rate.

Brett eats long-chain carbs like maltose, sucrose and starches. This has an
effect in wort production and our idea of fermentability. For instance, it's
possible to mash at a very high temperature and still create very fermentable
wort when using brettanomyces.

Brett can produce unique flavors and aromas from hops, fruits. It does this by
splitting off glycosides from other compounds found in hops and fruits.
Glycosides are simply these sugar compounds that are naturally attached to
compounds and, when split off, can be modified to their flavor and aroma-active
states. Saccharomyces is unable to create these flavors because it's not
capable of breaking off glycosides as brettanomyces can.

Beyond this, brett is capable of producing a very wide range of esters and
phenols. A great resource for learning about their characteristics and their
precursors can be found on the awesome [Milk The Funk
Wiki](http://www.milkthefunk.com/wiki/Brettanomyces#Secondary_Metabolites).

Brett can ferment glucose in the presence of oxygen.



Brett can form a pellicle.



To understand how to work with Brettanomyces, it's best to understand what compounds create flavors.
