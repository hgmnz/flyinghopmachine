Today I'm brewing something I haven't brewed before: A belgian blonde.

My objectives with this beer are:

<!--more-->

* Very crisp and clear appearance, should look a like a pilsener with good head.
* A bit of a malty and toasty aroma and flavor.
* Balanced hop bitterness and a bit of spicy hop aroma.
* High gravity and alcohol.
* Subtle and complex, easy drinking and delicious.

The majority of the grist is belgian pilsener, but I'm adding a bit of aromatic
malt to give it that distinct maltness that plays well with the pilsener. It
also has a bit of flaked wheat to aid with head retention and a bit of a creamy
body. I'm also adding 2 pounds of light beet sugar from
[candisyrup.com](http://candisyrup.com) to contribute some caramelly richness
but also to aid attenuation and get even higher gravity.

For this brew, I'm keeping it very classic as it comes to hop schedule. This is
not a hoppy beer, and the hops' contribution should be that of balance and a
bit of spicyness.

The glowing star for this beer is the yeast. I've had a lot of success with
WLP510 for big belgian brews, and I think it'll fit well with this beer for its
dry, acidic finish and the mild spicy notes it produces.

I plan on letting this one "lager" in a keg for at least a month before
carbonating to aid with clarification and let the high alcohol fusel flavors
mellow out.

The recipe ended up as follows:

*Grain bill:*

13 lb Belgian Pilsener Malt<br>
10 oz Aromatic Malt<br>
8 oz Flaked Wheat

*Hop schedule:*

60m: 1 oz Hallertau & 1oz Saaz<br>
2m: 5 0z Hallertau & 1 oz Saaz

*Other:*

Whirfloc tablet at 15 minutes left of the boil<br>
2 lb [Golden Candi Syrup](http://www.candisyrup.com/)

WLP510 - Bastogne Ale Yeast
