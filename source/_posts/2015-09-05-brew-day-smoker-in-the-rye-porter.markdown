You know what goes well with Rye? Smoke. For this robust porter, I'm looking
for a balance of rye spice, some smoke, along with the dry bitter, coffee,
chocolate notes found in dark and roasted malts.

For this beer, I used tap water given it is very high in carbonates and plays
well with dark beers. I did end up lowering its pH to 6.0 per the notes below.

The backbone of this brew is Crisp Best Ale, a British pale malt which is not
as neutral as american or canadian 2-row, providing a distinctive malty and
sweet foundation.

For rye, I used Briess Rye Malt as well as a bit of Weyermann Chocolate Rye
Malt.

For smoke, I chose two different smoked malts. First Weyermann Smoked Malt, a
beechwood smoked malt traditionally used in Rauchbier, along with Briess
Cherrywood Smoked Malt, which provides a much more pronounced smoke character
and is therefore used Sparingly.

Finally, a dash of Carafa III helps get the target color and a bit of more
roast character expected in a porter.

| Name                          | Amount | Percent     |
| ---------------------         | ------ | ----------- |
| Crisp Best Ale                | 6 lb   | 43.2 %      |
| Weyermann Smoked Malt         | 3 lb   | 21.6 %      |
| Briess Cherrywood Smoked Malt | 1 lb   | 7.2 %       |
| Briess Rye Malt               | 3 lb   | 21.6 %      |

| Weyermann Carafa III          | 4 oz   | 1.8 %       |

For this beer, I'll keep hops very classical and let them play a supportive
role. The grain bill will be layered with complexity while not allowing
individual flavors to overpower the grist.

## Brew notes

#### September 05, 2015

Started by treating brewing liquor to get pH down to 6.0. Initial water pH was
7.9, and I added 3ml - 6ml of phosphoric acid at a time to get to 6.0. Full
procedure was as follows:

| Amount of Phosphoric Acid Added | pH  |
| ------------------------------- | --  |
| 3ml                             | 7.2 |
| 3ml                             | 6.9 |
| 3ml                             | 6.7 |
| 3ml                             | 6.6 |
| 6ml                             | 6.4 |
| 6ml                             | 6.2 |
| 6ml                             | 6.0 |

Added 30 ml of phosphoric acid total.

Heated up strike water to 171 and Doughed-in. Mash temperature was on target at
154F.

Added 1/2 tsp Calcium Choloride to mash.

Sparged for 45 minutes to collect 8.5 gallons of wort in the kettle, while I enjoyed a [Salty Dog Gose](blog/2015/08/03/brew-day-salty-dog-gose/).

Added 1/4 teaspon of Gypsum and 1/2 teaspoon of Calcium Chloride to kettle.

Started the boil, and 5 minutes later it got the hot break. At this point
started the 60 minute boil, adding ingredients per the recipe.

Cooled through the plate chiller, and collected 6 gallons of wort in the
fermenter.

Aerated and pitched entire starter in fermenter. Total volume is about 6.5
gallons, at an OG of 1.059.
