I'm diving in with mixed fermentation. For this beer I want to go for
a funky, sour, fruity and modestly high ABV beer.

<!--more-->

I've been doing a lot of research as I enter the world of wild and mixed
fermentations. I decided it's time to dive right in with what I hope is a
nicely soured and funky character beer. This is an investment in time, and I
plan on adding fruit down the road; potentially some raspberries or plums to
give this otherwise blonde brew a nice pink color.

I based this recipe largely on my recent [Blonde
Ale](blog/2015/06/21/brew-day-daddys-belgian-blonde-ale/) beer, which turned
out fantastic, with enough of a malt and grainy aroma and body that I think
will work great with some funky brett characters. I did make some changes to
the base beer based on my research, however.

I aim to embrace the funk on this one. That means doing a primary fermentation
with saccharomyces, followed by inoculation with other yeasts and bacteria to
eat up both what saccharomyces couldn't consume, but also what it produced.
Brettanomyces feats on long-chain starches as well as phenols produced by
saccharomyces, so I chose a brewer's yeast strain that wasn't very neutral.
Quite the opposite, I reached for my go-to belgian yeast strain: WLP510 -
Bastogne Belgian Ale, which has worked great for me on many brews past, and is
a high producer of complext esters and subdued phenols.

When fermenting with saccharomyces followed by brettanomyces and other lactic
acid bacteria (lactobacillus and pediococcus), I'm looking for long chain
complex carbohydrates to be available after primary fermentation completes. I
changed the recipe in two ways to encourage this. First, I targetted
alpha-amylase enzymes in the mash by mashing at 155F. This will produce less
fermentable wort for the saccharomyces strain, leaving behind those long chain
starches for brettanomyces to chew on.  Further, I steeped some flaked wheat in
the boil to also impart starches to be consumed by pediococcus when pitched in
secondary.

The other consideration when brewing a sour beer is the fact that lactobacillus
is inhibited by hops. It seems to be preferable to keep IBU contributions to
under 10. For this reason, I modified the hop schedule from the [Blonde
Ale](blog/2015/06/21/brew-day-daddys-belgian-blonde-ale/) by moving most of the
bittering hop additions to more of the flavor and aroma range, under 5 minutes
left of the boil.

I still have some time to plan out the brettanomyces/lactobacillus/pediococcus
belnd I will be pitching on this beer during secondary fermentation and aging.
I'm close enough to both [Russin River](http://russianriverbrewing.com/) and
[The Rare Barrel](https://www.therarebarrel.com/), so I might pick up a few
bottles and pitch some dregs as well!

The result should be a very pale wort, with less than 10 IBUs, and long starch
chains for the bugs to feast on. This will be a long experiment, so we won't
really know how it worked out until about year from now.

The recipe ended up as follows:

| Batch Size |  IBU   | OG    | FG    | ABV |
| ---------- |  ----- | ----- | ----- | --- |
| 6g         |  7.5   | 1.075 | ?     | ?   |

*Water*

I would have targetted my water profile just as I did for my [Blonde
Ale](blog/2015/06/21/brew-day-daddys-belgian-blonde-ale/), however I
encountered some issues that forced me to improvise, which you can read all
about [here](blog/2015/08/09/dont-trust-your-ro-water/). However, given proper
RO water, the approach taken before for a similar grist worked well, so here it
is:

Start with RO water. Treat strike water with:

| Name             | Amount  |
| ---------------- | ------  |
| Calcium Chloride | 1 tsp   |
| Gypsum           | 3/4 tsp |
| Phosphoric Acid  | 0.5ml   |

*Fermentables*

| Name                                             | Amount | Percent     | Use          |
| ---------------------                            | ------ | ----------- | ------------ |
| Belgian Pilsen Malt                              | 13lb   | 75.9%       | Mash         |
| Aromatic Malt                                    | 10oz   | 3.6%        | Mash         |
| Wheat Malt                                       | 8oz    | 2.9%        | Mash         |
| Flaked Wheat                                     | 8oz    | 2.9%        | Boil/Steeped |
| [Golden Candi Syrup](http://www.candisyrup.com/) | 2 lb   | 11.7%       | End of Boil  |

*Yeast*

| Name                       | Lab         | Attenuation | Amount                        |
| -------------------------- | ----------- | ----------  | -----                         |
| WLP510 Bastogne Ale Yeast  | White Labs  | 74 - 80%    | 1.8 liter starter with 1 vial |
| Brett/Lacto/Pedio blend    | TBD         | ?           | ?                             |

Mash at 155F

## Brew notes

#### August 8, 2015

While preparing strike water encountered a [nasty
issue](blog/2015/08/09/dont-trust-your-ro-water/) which I had to troubleshoot
for. Ended up blending RO water with tap water, adding a campdem tablet to
remove chlorine, and added 3/4 tsp Calcium Chloride plus 1/2 tsp of gypsum. 

Mash pH was 5.4.

Sparge took about one hour.

<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hgmnz/19821700903/in/album-72157655784368350/" title="Untitled"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/361/19821700903_573f29a00f_z.jpg" width="480" height="640" alt="Untitled"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

I didn't treat sparge water, and instead used the left-over RO water directly.
Given it's low pH there was no need for adjustment.

Fired up the kettle, and 12 minutes later got the hot break. Started the 60 minute boil at this point with the first hop addition.

Added the rest of ingredients to the boil per the recipe.

Chilled wort, aerated for roughly 40 minutes.

Pitched starter and set to ferment.

OG was 1.075

Racked to secondary. Gravity reading was 1.012.
