I started thinking about the holidays at year-end and wanted to brew something
that is a bit heavier and delicious for the colder weather. I decided to go
with an imperial stout. A beer like this needs to be let to sit for a few
months to let it peak, which means it's time to brew it now. I plan on transfering
this beer to secondary or a keg in about three weeks and let it mature there until
late November.

Providing a nice Bourbon Barrel character is easy at a homebrew scale. Just
soak some oak cubes in your favorite burbon for a few days, the oaks absorb the
liquor like sponges.  Then place them in a hop bag and add them to the beer.
This has worked for me before, but there's no reason adding plain oaks to the
beer and blending the spirit directly wouldn't work as well. Soaking them in
bourbon first is convenient however, as it helps sanitize the oak cubes and so
it's not necessary to boil them before use.

For this beer I'm looking for something bold, with lots of the characteristic
stout roasted malt character, smokey and coffee notes, not too sweet, full
bodied and lots of alcohol. I wanted the base malt to have some character to
it, and considered Maris Otter or other british malts. I also wanted to include
some rye to go with the bourbon theme, so ended up adding some flaked rye, which
should also aid with head stabilization.

The recipe is the following:

*Water*

For this beer, I simply used tap water from my area which has a very high
alkalinity as calcium carbonate and usually plays well with dark beers. The
only water adjustments done were a campden tablet to remove chlorine, and
1/2 a teaspoon of Calcium Chloride in the boil kettle, enough to have a higher
chloride to sulfate ratio.

## Brew notes

#### July 25, 2015

I collected 11 gallons of tap water, crushed a campden tablet and added it to the water. Ensured it dissolved completely. I transfered 6 and 1/4 gallons to my HLT and heated it up to 165F. Doughed in and mash started with a temperature of 151F.

<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hgmnz/20002837585/in/album-72157655784368350/" title="Untitled"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3676/20002837585_566b7ec8b5_z.jpg" width="480" height="640" alt="Untitled"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Slowly sparged with the rest of the water. Sparge took a full hour.

Added 1/2 teaspoon of Calcium Chloride to wort in kettle and turned on the burner.

Waited 10 minutes for hot break, and started the 60m countdown. Followed hop and other kettle additions.

Once the hour was complete, chilled wort to 70F and started aerating. Aerated for 45m, and pitched starter. Stirrer bar dropped into beer, woops!

Measured OG was 1.085.

Pitched the starter. Set up a blowoff tube right away, I expect aggressive fermentation.

This fermentation started *fast*. It had a lag time of just three hours.

Racked to secondary.

Gravity reading was 1.019.
