    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This time around I&rsquo;m looking to do a 100% Brettanomyces IPA. In fact, the first
100% Brett beer I brew, so this should be interesting.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>First things first: What flavors can be expected from a 100% Brettanomyces
fermentation? In reality, it&rsquo;s all sorts of flavors, except for neutral such
as with the Chico strain of brewer&rsquo;s yeast.</p>

<p>As with saccharomyces, brettanomyces is able to produce various esthers and
polyphenols. Different strains and species of brettanomyces are produce different
kinds of flavors. Brettanomyces is just a yeast after all, not a bacteria as is
often believed to be.</p>

<p>One of the exciting aspects of fermenting with Brett is that it is in fact a
wild yeast. As such it can take it&rsquo;s own course, and the brewer must be
somewhat on top of the flavors that it develops, paciently waiting for the right
time to drink. While I have no experience with brett fermentation yet, I expect the
flavor of this beer to change over time, and that&rsquo;s plain thrilling.</p>

<p>Brettanomyces can develop horsey, barnyard, fecal, sweaty, plastic flavors, as well as
pineapple, pear, stone fruit, sour and vinegar flavors.</p>

<p>While it is a wild yeast, I have chosen a known strain for this beer that should not be very heavy on the barnyard flavor and more forward with fruit. I hope this to be a very fruity IPA, with enough funk and dynamics to make it interesting. Whatever comes out, I&rsquo;m up for the journey.</p>

<p>Because of the fruit aromas and flavors expected from the brett fermentation, I
chose to use hops that would accentuate and play well with that profile.
Amarillo is flowery and citrusy, and one of my favorite hops to use I may add.
To that I&rsquo;ve added Galaxy for its passionfruit and again citrus character, and
finally chinook to layer in some spice and pine character along with it&rsquo;s
subtle grapefruit notes. My hope is I won&rsquo;t really be able to tell where the
brett starts and the hops continue - they should play together to create some
nice complexity unlike anything I&rsquo;ve only ever read about, such as Crooked
Stave&rsquo;s 100% Brett Citra IPA. Finally, Brett beers' perceived bitterness is lower
than that of saccharomyces, so not only did I first wort hopped this beer, but I also
added a doze of high alpha acid Warrior at 60m.</p>

<p>When making a 100% Brett beer, I consider production of wort as a primary driver for creating the right medium for brett to do it&rsquo;s thing. First of all, Brett chews up all sorts of sugars, unlike saccharomyces. Further, brett does not produce any glycerol, which contribute to saccharomyces beers' mouth feel. To top that off, brett can dry beers way out, so we want to help it out on the mouth feel front. For that reason, I mashed at a higher-than-usual temperature, and I added fermentables that aid in mouth feel such as carapils.</p>

<p>Another important consideration for 100% Brett beers is that pitching rate is very high, and therefore it&rsquo;s required to build up a good starter. Brett is also slower in general than sacc, so building up the starter will require a bit more planning, and fermentation itself will take about twice as long. I plan on letting this ferment at least 4 weeks, if not more.</p>

<p>The resulting recipe is as follows:</p>

<h2>Brew notes</h2>

<h4>September 1, 2015</h4>

<p>Created a starter with 300ml of 1.040 wort and one vial of WLP648. Kept starter
agitated on a stir plate.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hgmnz/21409667711/in/album-72157655784368350/" title="Untitled"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/691/21409667711_5358e5403c_z.jpg" width="480" height="640" alt="Untitled"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>This starter formed a pellicle, and lots of condensation in the flask in about 3 days.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hgmnz/21216909379/in/album-72157655784368350/" title="Untitled"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5734/21216909379_ea34a9647a_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="Untitled"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h4>September 5, 2015</h4>

<p>Created a larger 1.8l starter and pitched 300ml on it. During the transfer, I
did not notice any acetic acid/vinager aroma which is great.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hgmnz/21404830695/in/album-72157655784368350/" title="Untitled"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/745/21404830695_ded127b6b2_z.jpg" width="480" height="640" alt="Untitled"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Left starter on stir plate.</p>

<h4>September 6, 2015</h4>

<p>Moved starter off of stir plate and placed in fermentation chamber (ahem,
closet). Left it there until brew day.</p>

<h4>September 12, 2015.</h4>

<p>A few hours before pitching, I moved the starter to the stir plate again. There
wasn&rsquo;t a large pellicle to speak of, but there was plenty of activity and
CO<sub>2</sub> production.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hgmnz/20783871243/in/album-72157655784368350/" title="Untitled"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/696/20783871243_bc542b5a1d_z.jpg" width="640" height="640" alt="Untitled"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>I started this brew with RO water. Initial water pH was 5.7, which required no
further acidification nor other salt treatments as this water has very low
alkalinity.</p>

<p>I heated strike water to 174F, and doughed-in, resulting in a mash temperature
of 156F.</p>

<p>Mash pH was 5.4.</p>

<p>Sparged for about 55 minutes and collected 7.5 gallons of wort.</p>

<p>Added 1 tsp of gypsum and &frac14; tsp of Calcium Chloride to kettle for flavor.</p>

<p>Added boil additions per recipe.</p>

<p>Cold-crashed with a plate chiller, and moved wort to fermenter.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hgmnz/21398038425/in/album-72157655784368350/" title="Untitled"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5717/21398038425_ac93427998_z.jpg" width="480" height="640" alt="Untitled"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Aerated and pitched entire starter. OG was 1.060.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hgmnz/21378715586/in/album-72157655784368350/" title="Untitled"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/633/21378715586_a19ed477ab_z.jpg" width="513" height="640" alt="Untitled"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h4>September 14, 2015</h4>

<p>First signs of activity in fermentation. Creamypellicle starting to form.</p>

    <updated>2015-06-20T22:05:11-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.flyinghopmachine.com/blog/2015/06/20/brew-day-drink-with-the-flies-ipa-v2</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I recently brewed an IPA using only New Zealand and Australian hop varieties. I
was shooting for a very light colored, clear, crisp, and fruity IPA to enjoy in
the summer. <a href="https://instagram.com/p/4F-drjn2Qs/?taken-by=flyinghopmachine">Here&rsquo;s a
photo</a>. I used a
very simple grain bill consisting of 50/50 domestic 2-row and pilsener malts,
and added a half pound of wheat to aid in head retention.</p>

<p>For hops, I used Waimea, Australian Summer and Nelson Saivan as follows:</p>

<!--more-->


<p>FWH: 1oz Waimea, 1oz Nelson Sauvin<br>
30m: 1 oz Waimea<br>
5m: 1oz Australian Summer, 1oz Waimea<br>
0m: 1oz Nelson Sauvin 1oz Australian Summer<br>
Dry hop for 3 days: 1oz Waimea, 1oz Nelson Sauvin</p>

<p>I was also experimenting with large First Wort Hopping (FWH) additions while
avoiding any bittering additions at all. I was trying to see how much bittering
I could get from FWH alone. It may have been the hops used, or the process
itself, but I didn&rsquo;t really get much bittering from FWH, so that might be a
good technique for extracting a small amount of bittering from hops and
avoiding harsh bitterness. It&rsquo;s hard to tell how much of the flavor and aroma
profile comes from FWH in this beer as it had many other later hop additions.</p>

<p>In any case, it&rsquo;s an easy enough technique that I&rsquo;ll be including in more of my
brews going forward.</p>

<h2>Beer issues</h2>

<p>The resulting beer was OK, but it had some issues that I will address in this
version. Of course some of these are subjective, the brew itself was solid and
people wo try it seem to like it.</p>

<h3>Color and mouth feel</h3>

<p>It didn&rsquo;t have enough of a malt backbone, and honestly it fell a bit flat and
uninteresting. The color was super pale and yellow, which I was going for, but
I think it could use a bit more color, too.</p>

<p>To address this, I&rsquo;m changing the grist by removing the pilsener malt, and
replacing it with more 2-row and some Vienna and Munich malts to layer some
complexity without adding any significant sweetness. I&rsquo;m also adding a bit
of dextrin to increase body.</p>

<h3>Hop aroma</h3>

<p>It could definitely use more hop aroma and bitterness. I&rsquo;m now adding a proper
bittering addition with CTZ, one of my go-to bittering hops for it&rsquo;s high alpha
acid content. I&rsquo;m also pushing more hops to the later additions to get more
flavor out of them, and throwing Galaxy into the mix to get even more of a
tropical and grapefruit aroma and flavor.</p>

<p>In general, I like the direction of this combination of hops though, and that
remains the focus of my &ldquo;Drink with the flies&rdquo;.</p>

<h3>Yeast selection</h3>

<p>It could use a bit more ester production in fermentation, so I am switching
<a href="http://www.whitelabs.com/yeast/wlp001-california-ale-yeast">WLP001</a> with a bit
more flavorful but dry strain,
<a href="http://www.whitelabs.com/yeast/wlp007-dry-english-ale-yeast">WLP007</a>.</p>

<h3>Mash pH</h3>

<p>My mash pH on the last brew was at 5.8 and I corrected it by adding some
phosphoric acid right in the mash cooler. For this brew I&rsquo;ve changed the grist
by adding some Vienna and Munich malts, which are toasted malts that might add
some acidity in the mash, but not quite enough to get it to the 5.4 range. I&rsquo;m
keeping my salt additions as is, but also adding acidulated malt to help lower
the pH to 5.4.</p>

<h2>Brew notes</h2>

<h4>June 20, 2015</h4>

<p>Mash ended up at 146F. Boiled a quart of water and adjusted up to 149.
Mash pH was on target, 5.4.</p>

<p>Sparge water (RO) pH was of 8.0. I added 3ml of phosphoric acid to bring it
down. It was way too much, brought it down to 3.6, so I had to troubleshoot. I
added 2g of more RO water, but the buffering capacity of this water is so low,
it only brought it up to 4.1. I then replaced 1g of this water with tap water,
which has huge alkalinity in my area, and that brought it up to 5.4. I added a
half of a campdem tablet to not screw with cholrine which has given me
<a href="http://www.flyinghopmachine.com/blog/2015/06/20/brew-day-drink-with-the-flies-ipa-v2/">problems</a>
before. Final Sparge water pH was 5.3.</p>

<p>I sparged for 45m and collected 7.6g of wort. Waited for hot break which took
about 10m, and started the 60m hop addition.</p>

<p>At 15 minutes left of the boil, added a whirfloc tablet, something I do with
all my brews.</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t have enough hop bags, was missing one for the steap additions. I
decided to remove the CTZ bag, clean it up, and use that for the steap
addition. I didn&rsquo;t want to risk having too much trub in the kettle, but this
worked well. I removed the CTZ bag 1 minute before the boil was done.</p>

<p>Chilled down to 68 F with a plate chiller. Aerated wort for 40m, pitched my
yeast starter, and attached a blow-off tube right away. I expect this to be an
aggressive fermentation because of gravity and yeast choice.</p>

<p>OG: 1.078. This is Double IPA territory :)</p>

<h4>July 3, 2015</h4>

<p>Kegged beer. Gravity reading was 1.020, but it is still
fermenting. Also added dry hops of 1oz Waimea and 2 oz Nelson Saivon.</p>

<h4>July 6, 2015</h4>

<p>Removed Waimea and Nelson Saivon dry hop bags</p>

<h4>July 9, 2015</h4>

<p>Dry hopped with 2oz Galaxy</p>

<h4>July 13, 2015</h4>

<p>Removed 2oz Galaxy dry hops.
Smells heavily of passionfruit, might as well call it passion IPA! :)
It appears to continue to ferment as it is still generating CO<sub>2</sub>, so
leaving it in keg at room temperature until activity stops.</p>

<h4>July 25, 2015</h4>

<p>FG: 1.012 (resulting in an 8.8% ABV DIPA)
Set it in keezer and began carbonation.</p>
