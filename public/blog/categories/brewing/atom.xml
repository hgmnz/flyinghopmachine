    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After a couple of years brewing I came across one of the biggest difficulties
in my brewing to date. A bold, in your face, undeniable off-flavor had plagued
my (home) brewhouse. The flavor was medicinal, plastic-like, pool-like and very
very overruling. I lost four 5 gallon batches of homebrew, and this is the
story of my quest to find out what was the cause.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>I had never had a <em>bad</em> batch before then, and by bad I mean bad process, not
bad recipe. I screwed up many a recipes before. The intensity in this flavor
got me chasing a ghost for a few months. During these period, I brewed these
beers:</p>

<ol>
<li>Saison</li>
<li>Rye Smoked Porter</li>
<li>Rye IPA</li>
<li>Rye Smoked Porter</li>
</ol>


<p>In terms of brewing process, I made two changes before this off-flavor appeared
in my beers: Use a yeast starter, and wort aeration with an aquarium pump and
diffusion stone. Both of these changes were correcting high-gravity beers which
were coming out under-attenuated.</p>

<p>I first noticed the flavor on the Saison and the Smoked Porter, both of which I
brewed close enough to each other that I didn&rsquo;t know they both had this
off-flavor, as they were both fermenting at the same time.</p>

<p>I brewed the Rye IPA pretty much the day I found out about the off-flavor as
I racked them to kegs, and so I didn&rsquo;t really change anything about my
equipment or process for that brew. I was pretty much sending a batch of wort
to ferment, not knowing if it would have this flavor too. I went on
regardless, and for this batch I sampled it at various points during
fermentation in case it was a yeast produced flavor.</p>

<h1>The quest begins</h1>

<p>I took the Saison and the Smoked Porter to my awesome LHBS. After tasting it
there I was convinced this was not an easy thing to fix. The advice I got was
to deep clean everything, and to replace racking canes or hoses that might be
suspect.</p>

<p>I chill my wort with a Blichmann plate chiller, so the output wort hose for
this was suspect. I later replaced this hose, as well as my racking cane which
had some buildup. It turns out you can&rsquo;t <em>really</em> clean them well, it&rsquo;s good to
replace these every 6 - 12 months or so depending on how much you brew. I also
got a hose cleaning brush as I noticed some buildup in some hoses and the
in-line thermometer (for chilling wort) was.</p>

<p>I took the Saison and the Smoked Porter to my homebrew meetup, which includes
many experienced brewers as well as a BJCP judge. The obvious flavor was there,
everyone agreed, but nobody could tell me definitively what the flavor came
from. I got conflicting advice in that some folks assured me it wasn&rsquo;t a
bacterial flavor as those tend to turn beer acidic. So indeed, the plot
thickens.</p>

<p>Next up, I kegged my Rye IPA, and I was surprised and relieved that it had no
off-flavors. This was one of those beers that went fast because it was so darn
delicious!</p>

<p>Confident in the fact that there was nothing wrong with my equipment, I went on
to brew my Rye Smoked Porter again. At this point, I had deep-cleaned all of my
equipment, replaced suspect parts, and knew that it was clean of any bacteria.
After all, the previous brew went just fine.</p>

<p>This time around, I tried my wort/beer every step of the way, too. I was trying
to check for signs of this flavor every step of the way. Everything went great,
pitched my starter yeast, and off to primary fermentation it goes.</p>

<p>I sampled the fermenting beer 3 days in and it was clean. Five days in, same
thing. I&rsquo;m safe, I thought. Let it ferment all the way, for about 14 days, and
to my surprise the flavor was back when I kegged!</p>

<p>I still carbonated it. Before I poured this batch down the drain, I saved a few
bottles to get more help identifying what&rsquo;s up. I gave a bottle to a local
friendly brewery, who also asked me for the recipe and brewing notes.</p>

<p>Brewing notes included most notably that I used my local tap water, but removed
chlorine with campden tablets and boiling treatment, something that I&rsquo;ve done
successfuly in brews past.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s what they had to say:</p>

<p><blockquote><p>Strong antiseptic flavor. The phenols in the smoke are mixing crazy with possibly the chlorine in the water.  I would ditch the campden tables and go to carbon filtering. Pretty hard to diagnose with that strong off flavor. Biggest guess is chlorophenols esp with the smoked malts.</p></blockquote></p>

<h2>ChloroWHAT?</h2>

<p>Yeah, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlorophenol">chlorophenols</a>. These nasty
compounds are formed when phenols bond with chlorine. Phenol production is
evident in some malts and yeasts, notably smoked malts and saison yeasts among
many others, but not really on WLP001 used for the Rye IPA.</p>

<p>Alright, so this makes sense, but does this mean that campden tablets don&rsquo;t
work? No, it doesn&rsquo;t, and here&rsquo;s the last piece of the puzzle: I started
getting these off-flavors when I changed something about my brewing process,
and that was that I started doing yeast starters. And the kicker is, I was just
using tap water with no filtration or treatment to build my starters. Even
though we&rsquo;re just talking less than a couple of liters for starter water, this
seams to fit the bill.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve since switched to using RO or carbon-filtered water for my starters, and
haven&rsquo;t had a problem again, even after brewing the same recipes pressumably
containing the same phenol production.</p>

<h2>Lessons and Conclusions</h2>

<ul>
<li>Do not mess with Chlorine. I still trust campden tablets, but carbon
filtration, reverse osmosis, distillation, and boiling treatments are also
effective.</li>
<li>Beware of your yeast starter water! It can ruin a batch or three.</li>
<li>Good cleaning and sanitation practices are crucial. I always thought I did a
good job at this, but in the face of this issue I wasn&rsquo;t <em>sure</em> - there was
always a chance I was messing something up. As a result, I am now even more
thorough about cleaning and sanitation, and going forward an off-flavor will
be less likely to be sanitation related and might lead me to finding the
cause faster.</li>
</ul>
