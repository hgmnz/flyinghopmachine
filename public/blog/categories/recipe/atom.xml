    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I recently brewed an IPA using only New Zealand and Australian hop varieties. I
was shooting for a very light colored, clear, crisp, and fruity IPA to enjoy in
the summer. I used a very simple grain bill consisting of 50/50 domestic 2-row
and pilsener malts, and added a half pound of wheat to aid in head retention.</p>

<p>For hops, I used Waimea, Australian Summer and Nelson Saivan as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>FWH: 1oz Waimea, 1oz Nelson Sauvin</li>
<li>30m: 1 oz Waimea</li>
<li>5m: 1oz Australian Summer, 1oz Waimea</li>
<li>0m: 1oz Nelson Sauvin 1oz Australian Summer</li>
<li>Dry hop for 3 days: 1oz Waimea, 1oz Nelson Sauvin</li>
</ul>


<p>I was also experimenting with large First Wort Hopping (FWH) additions while
avoiding any bittering additions at all. I was trying to see how much bittering
I could get from FWH alone. It may have been the hops used, or the process
itself, but I didn&rsquo;t really get much bittering from FWH, so that might be a
good technique for extracting a small amount of bittering from hops. It&rsquo;s hard
to tell how much of the flavor and aroma profile comes from FWH in this beer as
it had many other later hop additions.</p>

<p>In any case, it&rsquo;s an easy enough technique that I&rsquo;ll be including in more of my
brews going forward.</p>

<h2>Beer issues</h2>

<p>The resulting beer was OK, but it had some issues that I will address in this
version:</p>

<h3>Color and mouth feel</h3>

<p>It didn&rsquo;t have enough of a malt backbone, and honestly it fell a bit flat and
uninteresting. The color was super pale and yellow, which I was going for, but
I think it could use a bit more color.</p>

<p>To address this, I&rsquo;m changing the grist by replacing some of the 2-row malt
with some Vienna and Munich malts to layer some complexity without adding any
significant sweetness, and I&rsquo;m also adding a bit of dextrin to increase body.</p>

<h3>Hop aroma</h3>

<p>It could definitely use more hop aroma and bitterness. I&rsquo;m now adding a proper
bittering addition with Centennial, one of my go-to bittering hops for it&rsquo;s
high alpha acid content and low cost. I&rsquo;m also pushing more hops to the later
additions to get more flavor out of them, and throwing Galaxy into the mix
to get even more of a tropical and grapefruit aroma and flavor.</p>

<h3>Yeast selection</h3>

<p>It could use a bit more ester production in fermentation, so I am switching
WLP001 with a bit more flavorful but dry strain, WLP007.</p>

<h3>Mash pH</h3>

<p>My mash pH on the last brew was at 5.8 and I corrected it by adding some
phosphoric acid right in the mash cooler. For this brew I&rsquo;ve changed the grist
by adding some Vienna and Munich malts, which are toasted malts that might add
some acidity in the mash. So I&rsquo;m going to leave my salt additions as is and
likely get to the right pH range.</p>

<p>The final recipe looks like this:</p>

<p>Water: RO treated with 1.5tsp gypsum and &frac14; tsp calcium chloride in strike
water. Add &frac14; tsp gypsum in boil.</p>

<p>5 lb American 2-row<br>
7 lb American pilsener<br>
2 lb Vienna<br>
1 lb Munich<br>
12oz Dextrin<br>
8oz Wheat Malt</p>

<p>FWH: 1oz Nelson Sauvin<br>
60m: 1z Centennial<br>
15m: 1 oz Waimea<br>
5m: 1oz Australian Summer, 1oz Galaxy<br>
0m: 1oz Nelson Sauvin, 1oz Waimea</p>

<p>WLP007 - Dry English Ale Yeast</p>

<p>Dry hop for 3 days:<br>
1 oz Waimea, 1 oz Galaxy</p>
