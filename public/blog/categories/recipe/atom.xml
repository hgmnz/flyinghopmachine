    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;m diving in with mixed fermentation. For this beer I want to go for
a funky, sour, fruity and modestly high ABV beer.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>I&rsquo;ve been doing a lot of research as I enter the world of wild and mixed
fermentations. I decided it&rsquo;s time to dive right in with what I hope is a
nicely soured and funky character beer. This is an investment in time, and I
plan on adding fruit down the road; potentially some raspberries to give this
otherwise blonde brew a nice pink color.</p>

<p>I based this recipe largely on my recent <a href="blog/2015/06/21/brew-day-daddys-belgian-blonde-ale/">Blonde
Ale</a> beer, which turned
out fantastic, with enough of a malt and grainy aroma and body that I think
will work great with some Brett. I did make some changes to the base beer based
on my research, however.</p>

<p>I aim to embrace the funk on this one. Based on my research that means doing a
primary fermentation with saccharomyces, followed by inoculation with other
yeasts and bacteria to eat up both what saccharomyces couldn&rsquo;t consume, but
also what it produced. Brettanomyces feats on long-chain starches as well as
phenols produced by saccharomyces, so I chose a brewer&rsquo;s yeast strain that
wasn&rsquo;t very neutral. Quite the opposite, I reached for my go-to belgian yeast
strain: WLP510 - Bastogne Belgian Ale, which has worked great for me on many
brews past, and is a high producer of complext esters and subdued phenols.</p>

<p>When fermenting with saccharomyces followed by brettanomyces and
other lactic acid bacteria (lactobacillus and pediococcus), I&rsquo;m looking for
long chains to be available after primary. I change the recipe in two ways to
accomplish this. First, I targetted alpha-amylase enzymes in the mash by
mashing at 155F. This will produce less fermentable wort for the saccharomyces
strain, leaving behind those long chain starches for brettanomyces to chew on.
Further, I steeped some flaked wheat in the boil to also provide some
long-chain carbohydrates to be consumed by the brettanomyces and pediococcus
bacteria when pitched in secondary.</p>

<p>The other consideration when brewing a sour beer is the fact that lactobacillus
is inhibited by hops. It seems to be preferable to keep IBU contributions to
under 10. For this reason, I modified the hop schedule from the <a href="blog/2015/06/21/brew-day-daddys-belgian-blonde-ale/">Blonde
Ale</a> by moving most of the
bittering hop additions to more of the flavor and aroma range, under 5 minutes
left of the boil.</p>

<p>I still have some time to plan out the brettanomyces/lactobacillus/pediococcus
mix I will be pitching on this beer during secondary fermentation and aging.
It&rsquo;d be awesome might find some nice bottle dregs from Russin River and The
Rare Barrel and pitch those as well!</p>

<p>The result should be a very pale wort, with less than 10 IBUs, and long starch
chains for the bugs to feast on. This will be a long experiment, so we won&rsquo;t
really know how it worked out until a year from now!</p>

<p>The recipe ended up as follows:</p>

<p><em>Water</em></p>

<p>I would have targetted my water profile just as I did for my <a href="blog/2015/06/21/brew-day-daddys-belgian-blonde-ale/">Blonde
Ale</a>, however I
encountered some issues that forced me to improvise, which you can read all
about <a href="blog/2015/08/09/dont-trust-your-ro-water/">here</a>. However, given proper
RO water, the approach taken before for a similar grist worked well, so here it

<p>Mash at 155F</p>

<h2>Brew notes</h2>

<h4>August 8, 2015</h4>

<p>While preparing strike water encountered a <a href="blog/2015/08/09/dont-trust-your-ro-water/">nasty
issue</a> which I had to troubleshoot
for. Ended up blending RO water with tap water, adding a campdem tablet to
remove chlorine, and added &frac34; tsp Calcium Chloride plus &frac12; tsp of gypsum.</p>

<p>Mash pH was 5.4.</p>

<p>Sparge took about one hour.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hgmnz/19821700903/in/album-72157655784368350/" title="Untitled"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/361/19821700903_573f29a00f_z.jpg" width="480" height="640" alt="Untitled"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t treat sparge water, and instead used the left-over RO water directly.
Given it&rsquo;s low pH there was no need for adjustment.</p>

<p>Fired up the kettle, and 12 minutes later got the hot break. Started the 60 minute boil at this point with the first hop addition.</p>

<p>Added the rest of ingredients to the boil per the recipe.</p>

<p>Chilled wort, aerated for roughly 40 minutes.</p>

<p>Pitched starter and set to ferment.</p>

<p>OG was 1.075</p>

    <updated>2015-08-03T20:57:53-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.flyinghopmachine.com/blog/2015/08/03/brew-day-salty-dog-gose</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I have been itching to bring in some critters into my brewery that weren&rsquo;t
saccharomyces for a little while. I&rsquo;ve been making a bit of research and
finally decided to jump right in. I think a Gose (or a Berliner Weisse for that
matter) are a great way to start this journey, because it does not require long
aging periods, and with hot side souring, it can reduce the chance of infecting
brewery equipment with bacteria.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>For this beer, I did what&rsquo;s called Kettle Souring or Sour Wort (?). The process
is fairly straightforward. It involves mashing as you usually would, chilling
wort to a range appropriate for your lactobacillus cultures, pitching
lactobacillus, and holding the temperature for a few days. Then, you may or may
not boil this wort, chill again as usual and pitch saccharomyces.</p>

<p>Lactobacillus eats up sugars and produce lactic acid which in turn lowers the
solution&rsquo;s pH. When souring wort, having a pH meter is important as it will
tell you when to stop. If it drops too low, then saccharomyces will be
inhibited, and if it&rsquo;s too high, then it won&rsquo;t be sour. Tasting the wort as you
measure pH is good advice as well - you&rsquo;ll know how it&rsquo;s progressing and when
it&rsquo;s just too much, although when it&rsquo;s carbonated it will be perceived as less
sour.</p>

<p>A characteristic of Goses is that they do not have any IBUs. I didn&rsquo;t add any
hops at all, except for a few in the mash just for fun. But it&rsquo;s notable that
in general hops will inhibit lactobacillus activity, again, depending on
species, so generally these beers have very little hops if at all.</p>

<p>For this time around, I am trying to go as simple as possible to get a feel for
the process. I did some research on the style, and ended up with the following
recipe:</p>

<table>
<thead>

<th> Batch Size </th>
<th>  IBU   </th>
<th> OG    </th>
<th> FG    </th>

<p><em>Water</em></p>

<p>Water chemistry was not something I found a lot of good information about.
Because this is a very light-colored beer, I started off with RO water. But I
didn&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;d be wise to go with completely soft water either, and it&rsquo;s not
a hoppy beer so I don&rsquo;t need a high sulfate to chloride ratio.  I just added a
quarter tsp of both Calcium Chloride and Gypsum in my strike water.  Along with
a little bit of acidulated malt that I included in the grist, this should bring
my mash pH to appropriate conversion levels.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, my pH meter broke down on brew day, so I was unable to measure
mash pH, nor wort starting pH prior to pitching lactobacillus. I&rsquo;ll just have
to measure these on my next Gose.</p>

<h2>Brew notes</h2>

<h4>July 26, 2015</h4>

<p>Built a starter inoculate with the lactobacillus package. I made it 2 full
liters. Chilled it to 95F. After pitching the package, the Erlenmeyer flask
filled pretty much to the top, which was the goal as to avoid any oxygen
between the wort and the bung. Placed an airlock and sealed it by wrapping
around with cling wrap.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hgmnz/19969590068/in/album-72157655784368350/" title="Untitled"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/383/19969590068_2a0f76a697_z.jpg" width="480" height="640" alt="Untitled"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h4>July 30, 2015</h4>

<p>Mashed in at 148F. Added calcium chloride and gypsum additions. Sparged and
boiled for 15 minutes to help volatalize DMS from the pilsener malt.</p>

<p>During the boil, I quickly cleaned up my plastic cooler/mash tun to be used
during wort souring to aid in maintaining an appropriate temperature.</p>

<p>Chilled wort using plate chiller straight into cooler, targeting 99-100F. It
wasn&rsquo;t easy to get this temperature, but by controlling the flow of water it
got it down.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hgmnz/20014356589/in/album-72157655784368350/" title="Untitled"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/281/20014356589_b37e6beb75_z.jpg" width="480" height="640" alt="Untitled"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>SG reading was 1.048.</p>

<p>Pitched entire lactobacillus starter into wort. After pitching, temperature was
98F.</p>

<p>Purged oxygen with CO2, closed down the cooler, and placed in warmest place
possible. Ideally you&rsquo;d control temperature and maintain it at 98F, which I
don&rsquo;t have equipment to do yet.</p>

<h4>July 30, 2015</h4>

<p>20 hours later, pH dropped to 3.5 and temperature dropped to 87F. I know it&rsquo;s
called &ldquo;Fast Souring Lacto&rdquo; but this seems <em>very</em> fast! Probably also due to
the fact that RO water was used, and I didn&rsquo;t add any bicarbonates, so
alkalinity on this water is definitely low.</p>

<p>Built a started with one vial of WLP029 and yeast nutrients.</p>

<h4>Aug 1, 2015</h4>

<p>pH dropped to 3.3 and temperature to 80F. It&rsquo;s definitely time to stop
lactobacillus activity, which I did by boiling the wort.</p>

<p>Wort tasted nice and sour, but very clean. Getting pumped!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hgmnz/20183503406/in/album-72157655784368350/" title="Untitled"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5617/20183503406_8bfd689c58_z.jpg" width="480" height="640" alt="Untitled"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>I crushed the coriander seeds by placing them in a bag and using a kitchen
roller.</p>

<p>During the boil I added a Whirfloc tablet, yeast nutrients, coriander and salt</p>

<p>After boiling it, chilled as usual, aerated, and pitched WLP029 starter.</p>

<p>SG reading was 1.023, so this lacto did attenuate the wort a bit.</p>

<h2>What I&rsquo;d do differently</h2>

<ul>
<li>For the lactobacillus starter, there are
<a href="http://www.milkthefunk.com/wiki/Lactobacillus#Starters_and_Pitching_Rate">experiments</a>
which show using a bit of apple juice yield a more appropriate environment for
lacto. Further, I&rsquo;ll add some yeast nutrients which I didn&rsquo;t do this time.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;d do more research on appropriate water profile, although it seems to me
chloride and sulfate won&rsquo;t play a big role in a sour beer like this. I might
consider simply using acidulated malt and phophoric acid to tune in on an
appropriate mash pH.</li>
<li>I boiled for a full 60 minutes, but I don&rsquo;t see any reason to having done
that. Next time, a 15 minute wort with the remaining ingredients might be
enough.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ll add &ldquo;test pH meter&rdquo; to my pre-brewing flight check.</li>
</ul>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I started thinking about the holidays at year-end and wanted to brew something
that is a bit heavier and delicious for the colder weather. I decided to go
with an imperial stout. A beer like this needs to be let to sit for a few
months to let it peak, which means it&rsquo;s time to brew it now. I plan on transfering
this beer to secondary or a keg in about three weeks and let it mature there until
late November.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>Providing a nice Bourbon Barrel character is easy at a homebrew scale. Just
soak some oak cubes in your favorite burbon for a few days, the oaks absorb the
liquor like sponges.  Then place them in a hop bag and add them to the beer.
This has worked for me before, but there&rsquo;s no reason adding plain oaks to the
beer and blending the spirit directly wouldn&rsquo;t work as well. Soaking them in
bourbon first is convenient however, as it helps sanitize the oak cubes and so
it&rsquo;s not necessary to boil them before use.</p>

<p>For this beer I&rsquo;m looking for something bold, with lots of the characteristic
stout roasted malt character, smokey and coffee notes, not too sweet, full
bodied and lots of alcohol. I wanted the base malt to have some character to
it, and considered Maris Otter or other british malts. I also wanted to include
some rye to go with the bourbon theme, so ended up adding some flaked rye, which
should also aid with head stabilization.</p>

<p><em>Water</em></p>

<p>For this beer, I simply used tap water from my area which has a very high
alkalinity as calcium carbonate and usually plays well with dark beers. The
only water adjustments done were a campden tablet to remove chlorine, and
&frac12; a teaspoon of Calcium Chloride in the boil kettle, enough to have a higher
chloride to sulfate ratio.</p>

<h2>Brew notes</h2>

<h4>July 25, 2015</h4>

<p>I collected 11 gallons of tap water, crushed a campden tablet and added it to the water. Ensured it dissolved completely. I transfered 6 and &frac14; gallons to my HLT and heated it up to 165F. Doughed in and mash started with a temperature of 151F.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hgmnz/20002837585/in/album-72157655784368350/" title="Untitled"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3676/20002837585_566b7ec8b5_z.jpg" width="480" height="640" alt="Untitled"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Slowly sparged with the rest of the water. Sparge took a full hour.</p>

<p>Added &frac12; teaspoon of Calcium Chloride to wort in kettle and turned on the burner.</p>

<p>Waited 10 minutes for hot break, and started the 60m countdown. Followed hop and other kettle additions.</p>

<p>Once the hour was complete, chilled wort to 70F and started aerating. Aerated for 45m, and pitched starter. Stirrer bar dropped into beer, woops!</p>

<p>Measured OG was 1.085.</p>

<p>Pitched the starter. Set up a blowoff tube right away, I expect aggressive fermentation.</p>

<p>This fermentation started <em>fast</em>. It had a lag time of just three hours.</p>

    <updated>2015-07-03T20:36:43-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.flyinghopmachine.com/blog/2015/07/03/brew-day-independence-saison</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today I brewed a variation on a recipe that I&rsquo;ve worked on for some time. This
beer is being brewed for a special professional event. I&rsquo;ll be given the chance
to talk about the brewing process, and given the audience is engineers and
bio-medical scientists I might dive into water chemistry and focus on that.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>I was asked to bring what I consider to be &ldquo;my best brew.&rdquo; This is of course a
terrible question to ask a brewer, just like a dad doesn&rsquo;t have a favorite
child. Right, right? So instead I thought about who the audience is, what the
environment is like, and what I thought they&rsquo;d like the most. There will be
other homebrewers and there will be a prize for best beer, so let&rsquo;s aim for
that! In this case, I think I&rsquo;ll be pouring beer to engineers who are open to
some experimentation but aren&rsquo;t really familiar with the breadth of flavors that
exist in beer, so I wanted to step a bit outside their comfort area while still
bringing something approachable and very drinkable for many palettes. I had to
stay away from harsh or aggressive flavors, but want it to be exotic enough to
leave an impression. Things like barley wine, double/tripple IPAs, Imperial
stouts, might be a bit too aggressive for this purpose. On the other hand Pale
Ales, Pilseners, or Kölsh might be too safe. I decided to go with a saison that
has enough of an edge to be interesting, but might be familiar in other ways
such as color and hop profile. We&rsquo;ll see how this goes!</p>

<p>This is a beer I&rsquo;ve brewed a lot before and I&rsquo;ve gone through a great deal of
experimentation before arriving at a flavor profile I really loved. I&rsquo;ve gone
through various yeast strains and hop varieties. I particularly love the
introduction of american citrusy hops with the french saison strain, so we&rsquo;ll
be using lots of that.</p>

<p>To play homage to the all-but-the-kitchen-sink tradition of farmhouse ales, I
added just a bit of flaked rye to this recipe. I&rsquo;ve always had some flaked
wheat in there too, yielding an awesome, white long lasting head.</p>

<p>It is still a very light grist, and based on the success of using acidulated
malt in <a href="/blog/2015/06/20/brew-day-drink-with-the-flies-ipa-v2/">a recent
brew</a>, I decided to add
some of that here as well.  Unfortunately that didn&rsquo;t turn out very well (read
more below!), so I will be reducing or removing that completely next time I
brew this beer.</p>

<h2>Brew notes</h2>

<h4>July 3, 2015</h4>

<p>I treaded RO water per the recipe, lowering strike water pH to 6.1. Strike
water was at 162F, and the mash ended up at 146F. I quickly heated up some
water and added it in to raise the temperature to 151F.</p>

<p>Initial reading of the mash pH was 4.9. The acidulated malt present in the
mash, along with the phosphoric acid used, the very little buffering capacity in
my RO water, and the calcium added with the salt treatments, lowered the pH way
too much. <strong>Next time reduce or remove acidulated malt from grist!</strong> To solve
this, I added NaHCO<sub>3</sub> (Baking soda) in half teaspoon increments
until the mash adjusted up to 5.2. I added a total of one teaspoon and the pH
was spot on. Crisis adverted!</p>

<p>I mashed for 90 minutes, and fly-sparged for 40 minutes. I collected 8 gallons
of wort as I expect a lot of loss to the whole hops and the long boiling time.
Fired up the kettle and 17 minutes later I got the hot break. At this
point I started the 90 minute boil.</p>

<p>Had a nice rolling boil for 90 minutes, adding hops and other additions per the
recipe. Ended up with 6.5 gallons in the kettle.</p>

<p>Chilled and collected 5.5 gallons of wort in the fermenter, spot on.</p>

<p>Pitched the yeast starter that I had prepared the previous day, and set it to
ferment at room temperature, about 68F.</p>

<p>Measured OG was 1.065</p>

<h4>July 26, 2015</h4>

<p>Kegged beer and left it at room temperature.
FG was 1.006. ABV is 7.8%</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today I&rsquo;m brewing something I haven&rsquo;t brewed before: A belgian blonde.</p>

<p>My objectives with this beer are:</p>

<!--more-->


<ul>
<li>Very crisp and clear appearance, should look a like a pilsener with good head.</li>
<li>A bit of a malty and toasty aroma and flavor.</li>
<li>Balanced hop bitterness and a bit of spicy hop aroma.</li>
<li>High gravity and alcohol.</li>
<li>Subtle and complex, easy drinking and delicious.</li>
</ul>


<p>The majority of the grist is belgian pilsener, but I&rsquo;m adding a bit of aromatic
malt to give it that distinct maltness that plays well with the pilsener. It
also has a bit of flaked wheat to aid with head retention and a bit of a creamy
body. I&rsquo;m also adding 2 pounds of light beet sugar from
<a href="http://candisyrup.com">candisyrup.com</a> to contribute some caramelly richness
but also to aid attenuation and get even higher gravity.</p>

<p>For this brew, I&rsquo;m keeping it very classic as it comes to hop schedule. This is
not a hoppy beer, and the hops' contribution should be that of balance and a
bit of spicyness.</p>

<p>The glowing star for this beer is the yeast. I&rsquo;ve had a lot of success with
WLP510 for big belgian brews, and I think it&rsquo;ll fit well with this beer for its
dry, acidic finish and the mild spicy notes it produces.</p>

<p>I plan on letting this one &ldquo;lager&rdquo; in a keg for at least a month before
carbonating to aid with clarification and let the high alcohol fusel flavors
mellow out.</p>

<p>Mash at 151F for 90 minutes.
Boil for 90 minutes to reduce chance of DMS.</p>

<h2>Brew notes</h2>

<h4>June 21</h4>

<p>I Treated RO water per the recipe. This brought strike water pH down to 6.1.
Along with the salt additions, the mash pH was on target, at 5.4.  Didn&rsquo;t have
to treat mash pH at all, even for such a light-colored grist.  The approach of
using phosphoric acid in strike water rather than adding acidulated malt is one
that works well.</p>

<p>I mashed at 151F.</p>

<p>For sparge water, I added 0.5ml of phosphoric acid which brought it down to a
pH of 5.7. This is about the right amount of phosphoric acid to add the sparge
water without overshooting it!</p>

<p><a href="https://instagram.com/p/4NVgr1H2cu/?taken-by=flyinghopmachine">I collected 8 gallons of 1.055 wort</a>.</p>

<p>Fired up the kettle, it started boiling 12 minutes later, and got to the hot
break 4 minutes after that. At this point I started the 90 minute boil.</p>

<p>Added kettle additions per the recipe.</p>

<p>Post-boil volume was 6.3 gallons. Chilled and transfered to fermenter where I
aerated for roughly 40 minutes.</p>

<p>Pitched two vials of WLP510 as I hadn&rsquo;t prepared a starter this time around.
Stored fermenter at room temperature where it will sit for ~2 weeks.</p>

<p>OG was 1.065</p>

<h4>July 12</h4>

<p>Kegged and took <a href="https://instagram.com/p/5DXyEgn2ck/">a gravity reading</a>. Ended
at 1.011. Leaving at room temp until there&rsquo;s space in my keezer.</p>
