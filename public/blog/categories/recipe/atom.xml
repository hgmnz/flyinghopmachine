    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This time around I&rsquo;m looking to do a 100% Brettanomyces IPA. In fact, the first
100% Brett beer I brew, so this should be interesting.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>First things first: What flavors can be expected from a 100% Brettanomyces
fermentation? In reality, it&rsquo;s all sorts of flavors, except for neutral such
as with the Chico strain of brewer&rsquo;s yeast.</p>

<p>As with saccharomyces, brettanomyces is able to produce various esthers and
polyphenols. Different strains and species of brettanomyces are produce different
kinds of flavors. Brettanomyces is just a yeast after all, not a bacteria as is
often believed to be.</p>

<p>One of the exciting aspects of fermenting with Brett is that it is in fact a
wild yeast. As such it can take it&rsquo;s own course, and the brewer must be
somewhat on top of the flavors that it develops, paciently waiting for the right
time to drink. While I have no experience with brett fermentation yet, I expect the
flavor of this beer to change over time, and that&rsquo;s plain thrilling.</p>

<p>Brettanomyces can develop horsey, barnyard, fecal, sweaty, plastic flavors, as well as
pineapple, pear, stone fruit, sour and vinegar flavors.</p>

<p>While it is a wild yeast, I have chosen a known strain for this beer that should not be very heavy on the barnyard flavor and more forward with fruit. I hope this to be a very fruity IPA, with enough funk and dynamics to make it interesting. Whatever comes out, I&rsquo;m up for the journey.</p>

<p>Because of the fruit aromas and flavors expected from the brett fermentation, I
chose to use hops that would accentuate and play well with that profile.
Amarillo is flowery and citrusy, and one of my favorite hops to use I may add.
To that I&rsquo;ve added Galaxy for its passionfruit and again citrus character, and
finally chinook to layer in some spice and pine character along with it&rsquo;s
subtle grapefruit notes. My hope is I won&rsquo;t really be able to tell where the
brett starts and the hops continue - they should play together to create some
nice complexity unlike anything I&rsquo;ve only ever read about, such as Crooked
Stave&rsquo;s 100% Brett Citra IPA. Finally, Brett beers' perceived bitterness is lower
than that of saccharomyces, so not only did I first wort hopped this beer, but I also
added a doze of high alpha acid Warrior at 60m.</p>

<p>When making a 100% Brett beer, I consider production of wort as a primary driver for creating the right medium for brett to do it&rsquo;s thing. First of all, Brett chews up all sorts of sugars, unlike saccharomyces. Further, brett does not produce any glycerol, which contribute to saccharomyces beers' mouth feel. To top that off, brett can dry beers way out, so we want to help it out on the mouth feel front. For that reason, I mashed at a higher-than-usual temperature, and I added fermentables that aid in mouth feel such as carapils.</p>

<p>Another important consideration for 100% Brett beers is that pitching rate is very high, and therefore it&rsquo;s required to build up a good starter. Brett is also slower in general than sacc, so building up the starter will require a bit more planning, and fermentation itself will take about twice as long. I plan on letting this ferment at least 4 weeks, if not more.</p>

<p>The resulting recipe is as follows:</p>

<h2>Brew notes</h2>

<h4>September 1, 2015</h4>

<p>Created a starter with 300ml of 1.040 wort and one vial of WLP648. Kept starter
agitated on a stir plate.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hgmnz/21409667711/in/album-72157655784368350/" title="Untitled"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/691/21409667711_5358e5403c_z.jpg" width="480" height="640" alt="Untitled"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>This starter formed a pellicle, and lots of condensation in the flask in about 3 days.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hgmnz/21216909379/in/album-72157655784368350/" title="Untitled"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5734/21216909379_ea34a9647a_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="Untitled"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h4>September 5, 2015</h4>

<p>Created a larger 1.8l starter and pitched 300ml on it. During the transfer, I
did not notice any acetic acid/vinager aroma which is great.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hgmnz/21404830695/in/album-72157655784368350/" title="Untitled"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/745/21404830695_ded127b6b2_z.jpg" width="480" height="640" alt="Untitled"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Left starter on stir plate.</p>

<h4>September 6, 2015</h4>

<p>Moved starter off of stir plate and placed in fermentation chamber (ahem,
closet). Left it there until brew day.</p>

<h4>September 12, 2015.</h4>

<p>A few hours before pitching, I moved the starter to the stir plate again. There
wasn&rsquo;t a large pellicle to speak of, but there was plenty of activity and
CO<sub>2</sub> production.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hgmnz/20783871243/in/album-72157655784368350/" title="Untitled"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/696/20783871243_bc542b5a1d_z.jpg" width="640" height="640" alt="Untitled"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>I started this brew with RO water. Initial water pH was 5.7, which required no
further acidification nor other salt treatments as this water has very low
alkalinity.</p>

<p>I heated strike water to 174F, and doughed-in, resulting in a mash temperature
of 156F.</p>

<p>Mash pH was 5.4.</p>

<p>Sparged for about 55 minutes and collected 7.5 gallons of wort.</p>

<p>Added 1 tsp of gypsum and &frac14; tsp of Calcium Chloride to kettle for flavor.</p>

<p>Added boil additions per recipe.</p>

<p>Cold-crashed with a plate chiller, and moved wort to fermenter.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hgmnz/21398038425/in/album-72157655784368350/" title="Untitled"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5717/21398038425_ac93427998_z.jpg" width="480" height="640" alt="Untitled"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Aerated and pitched entire starter. OG was 1.060.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hgmnz/21378715586/in/album-72157655784368350/" title="Untitled"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/633/21378715586_a19ed477ab_z.jpg" width="513" height="640" alt="Untitled"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h4>September 14, 2015</h4>

<p>First signs of activity in fermentation. Creamypellicle starting to form.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>You know what goes well with Rye? Smoke. For this robust porter, I&rsquo;m looking
for a balance of rye spice, some smoke, along with the dry bitter, coffee,
chocolate notes found in dark and roasted malts.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>For this beer, I used tap water given it is very high in carbonates and plays
well with dark beers. I did end up lowering its pH to 6.0 per the notes below.</p>

<p>The backbone of this brew is Crisp Best Ale, a British pale malt which is not
as neutral as american or canadian 2-row, providing a distinctive malty and
sweet foundation.</p>

<p>For rye, I used Briess Rye Malt as well as a bit of Weyermann Chocolate Rye
Malt.</p>

<p>For smoke, I chose two different smoked malts. First Weyermann Smoked Malt, a
beechwood smoked malt traditionally used in Rauchbier, along with Briess
Cherrywood Smoked Malt, which provides a much more pronounced smoke character
and is therefore used Sparingly.</p>

<p>Finally, a dash of Carafa III helps get the target color and a bit of more
roast character expected in a porter.</p>

    <id>http://www.flyinghopmachine.com/blog/2015/08/09/brew-day-funk-you-blonde-ale</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;m diving in with mixed fermentation. For this beer I want to go for
a funky, sour, fruity and modestly high ABV beer.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>I&rsquo;ve been doing a lot of research as I enter the world of wild and mixed
fermentations. I decided it&rsquo;s time to dive right in with what I hope is a
nicely soured and funky character beer. This is an investment in time, and I
plan on adding fruit down the road; potentially some raspberries or plums to
give this otherwise blonde brew a nice pink color.</p>

<p>I based this recipe largely on my recent <a href="blog/2015/06/21/brew-day-daddys-belgian-blonde-ale/">Blonde
Ale</a> beer, which turned
out fantastic, with enough of a malt and grainy aroma and body that I think
will work great with some funky brett characters. I did make some changes to
the base beer based on my research, however.</p>

<p>I aim to embrace the funk on this one. That means doing a primary fermentation
with saccharomyces, followed by inoculation with other yeasts and bacteria to
eat up both what saccharomyces couldn&rsquo;t consume, but also what it produced.
Brettanomyces feats on long-chain starches as well as phenols produced by
saccharomyces, so I chose a brewer&rsquo;s yeast strain that wasn&rsquo;t very neutral.
Quite the opposite, I reached for my go-to belgian yeast strain: WLP510 -
Bastogne Belgian Ale, which has worked great for me on many brews past, and is
a high producer of complext esters and subdued phenols.</p>

<p>When fermenting with saccharomyces followed by brettanomyces and other lactic
acid bacteria (lactobacillus and pediococcus), I&rsquo;m looking for long chain
complex carbohydrates to be available after primary fermentation completes. I
changed the recipe in two ways to encourage this. First, I targetted
alpha-amylase enzymes in the mash by mashing at 155F. This will produce less
fermentable wort for the saccharomyces strain, leaving behind those long chain
starches for brettanomyces to chew on.  Further, I steeped some flaked wheat in
the boil to also impart starches to be consumed by pediococcus when pitched in
secondary.</p>

<p>The other consideration when brewing a sour beer is the fact that lactobacillus
is inhibited by hops. It seems to be preferable to keep IBU contributions to
under 10. For this reason, I modified the hop schedule from the <a href="blog/2015/06/21/brew-day-daddys-belgian-blonde-ale/">Blonde
Ale</a> by moving most of the
bittering hop additions to more of the flavor and aroma range, under 5 minutes
left of the boil.</p>

<p>I still have some time to plan out the brettanomyces/lactobacillus/pediococcus
belnd I will be pitching on this beer during secondary fermentation and aging.
I&rsquo;m close enough to both <a href="http://russianriverbrewing.com/">Russin River</a> and
<a href="https://www.therarebarrel.com/">The Rare Barrel</a>, so I might pick up a few
bottles and pitch some dregs as well!</p>

<p>The result should be a very pale wort, with less than 10 IBUs, and long starch
chains for the bugs to feast on. This will be a long experiment, so we won&rsquo;t
really know how it worked out until about year from now.</p>

<p>The recipe ended up as follows:</p>

<p>I would have targetted my water profile just as I did for my <a href="blog/2015/06/21/brew-day-daddys-belgian-blonde-ale/">Blonde
Ale</a>, however I
encountered some issues that forced me to improvise, which you can read all
about <a href="blog/2015/08/09/dont-trust-your-ro-water/">here</a>. However, given proper
RO water, the approach taken before for a similar grist worked well, so here it

<p>Mash at 155F</p>

<h2>Brew notes</h2>

<h4>August 8, 2015</h4>

<p>While preparing strike water encountered a <a href="blog/2015/08/09/dont-trust-your-ro-water/">nasty
issue</a> which I had to troubleshoot
for. Ended up blending RO water with tap water, adding a campdem tablet to
remove chlorine, and added &frac34; tsp Calcium Chloride plus &frac12; tsp of gypsum.</p>

<p>Mash pH was 5.4.</p>

<p>Sparge took about one hour.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hgmnz/19821700903/in/album-72157655784368350/" title="Untitled"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/361/19821700903_573f29a00f_z.jpg" width="480" height="640" alt="Untitled"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t treat sparge water, and instead used the left-over RO water directly.
Given it&rsquo;s low pH there was no need for adjustment.</p>

<p>Fired up the kettle, and 12 minutes later got the hot break. Started the 60 minute boil at this point with the first hop addition.</p>

<p>Added the rest of ingredients to the boil per the recipe.</p>

<p>Chilled wort, aerated for roughly 40 minutes.</p>

<p>Pitched starter and set to ferment.</p>

<p>OG was 1.075</p>

    <updated>2015-08-03T20:57:53-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.flyinghopmachine.com/blog/2015/08/03/brew-day-salty-dog-gose</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I have been itching to bring in some critters into my brewery that weren&rsquo;t
saccharomyces for a little while. I&rsquo;ve been making a bit of research and
finally decided to jump right in. I think a Gose (or a Berliner Weisse for that
matter) are a great way to start this journey, because it does not require long
aging periods, and with hot side souring, it can reduce the chance of infecting
brewery equipment with bacteria.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>For this beer, I did what&rsquo;s called Kettle Souring or Sour Wort (?). The process
is fairly straightforward. It involves mashing as you usually would, chilling
wort to a range appropriate for your lactobacillus cultures, pitching
lactobacillus, and holding the temperature for a few days. Then, you may or may
not boil this wort, chill again as usual and pitch saccharomyces.</p>

<p>Lactobacillus eats up sugars and produce lactic acid which in turn lowers the
solution&rsquo;s pH. When souring wort, having a pH meter is important as it will
tell you when to stop. If it drops too low, then saccharomyces will be
inhibited, and if it&rsquo;s too high, then it won&rsquo;t be sour. Tasting the wort as you
measure pH is good advice as well - you&rsquo;ll know how it&rsquo;s progressing and when
it&rsquo;s just too much, although when it&rsquo;s carbonated it will be perceived as less
sour.</p>

<p>A characteristic of Goses is that they do not have any IBUs. I didn&rsquo;t add any
hops at all, except for a few in the mash just for fun. But it&rsquo;s notable that
in general hops will inhibit lactobacillus activity, again, depending on
species, so generally these beers have very little hops if at all.</p>

<p>For this time around, I am trying to go as simple as possible to get a feel for
the process. I did some research on the style, and ended up with the following
recipe:</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th> Batch Size </th>
<th>  IBU   </th>
<th> OG    </th>
<th> FG    </th>
<th> ABV </th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td> 6g         </td>
<td>  0     </td>
<td> 1.047 </td>
<td> 1.011 </td>
<td> 4.7 </td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


<p><em>Water</em></p>

<p>Water chemistry was not something I found a lot of good information about.
Because this is a very light-colored beer, I started off with RO water. But I
didn&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;d be wise to go with completely soft water either, and it&rsquo;s not
a hoppy beer so I don&rsquo;t need a high sulfate to chloride ratio.  I just added a
quarter tsp of both Calcium Chloride and Gypsum in my strike water.  Along with
a little bit of acidulated malt that I included in the grist, this should bring
my mash pH to appropriate conversion levels.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, my pH meter broke down on brew day, so I was unable to measure
mash pH, nor wort starting pH prior to pitching lactobacillus. I&rsquo;ll just have
to measure these on my next Gose.</p>

<h2>Brew notes</h2>

<h4>July 26, 2015</h4>

<p>Built a starter inoculate with the lactobacillus package. I made it 2 full
liters. Chilled it to 95F. After pitching the package, the Erlenmeyer flask
filled pretty much to the top, which was the goal as to avoid any oxygen
between the wort and the bung. Placed an airlock and sealed it by wrapping
around with cling wrap.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hgmnz/19969590068/in/album-72157655784368350/" title="Untitled"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/383/19969590068_2a0f76a697_z.jpg" width="480" height="640" alt="Untitled"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h4>July 30, 2015</h4>

<p>Mashed in at 148F. Added calcium chloride and gypsum additions. Sparged and
boiled for 15 minutes to help volatalize DMS from the pilsener malt.</p>

<p>During the boil, I quickly cleaned up my plastic cooler/mash tun to be used
during wort souring to aid in maintaining an appropriate temperature.</p>

<p>Chilled wort using plate chiller straight into cooler, targeting 99-100F. It
wasn&rsquo;t easy to get this temperature, but by controlling the flow of water it
got it down.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hgmnz/20014356589/in/album-72157655784368350/" title="Untitled"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/281/20014356589_b37e6beb75_z.jpg" width="480" height="640" alt="Untitled"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>SG reading was 1.047.</p>

<p>Pitched entire lactobacillus starter into wort. After pitching, temperature was
98F.</p>

<p>Purged oxygen with CO2, closed down the cooler, and placed in warmest place
possible. Ideally you&rsquo;d control temperature and maintain it at 98F, which I
don&rsquo;t have equipment to do yet.</p>

<h4>July 30, 2015</h4>

<p>20 hours later, pH dropped to 3.5 and temperature dropped to 87F. I know it&rsquo;s
called &ldquo;Fast Souring Lacto&rdquo; but this seems <em>very</em> fast! Probably also due to
the fact that RO water was used, and I didn&rsquo;t add any bicarbonates, so
alkalinity on this water is definitely low.</p>

<p>Built a started with one vial of WLP029 and yeast nutrients.</p>

<h4>Aug 1, 2015</h4>

<p>pH dropped to 3.3 and temperature to 80F. It&rsquo;s definitely time to stop
lactobacillus activity, which I did by boiling the wort.</p>

<p>Wort tasted nice and sour, but very clean. Getting pumped!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hgmnz/20183503406/in/album-72157655784368350/" title="Untitled"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5617/20183503406_8bfd689c58_z.jpg" width="480" height="640" alt="Untitled"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>I crushed the coriander seeds by placing them in a bag and using a kitchen
roller.</p>

<p>During the boil I added a Whirfloc tablet, yeast nutrients, coriander and salt</p>

<p>After boiling it, chilled as usual, aerated, and pitched WLP029 starter.</p>

<p>SG reading was 1.023, so this lacto did attenuate the wort a bit.</p>

<h4>Aug 13, 2015</h4>

<p>Racked off of primary onto secondary. Wort was <em>very</em> clear. SG was 1.011.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hgmnz/20966157805/in/album-72157655784368350/" title="Untitled"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5728/20966157805_36c65600b9_z.jpg" width="480" height="640" alt="Untitled"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h4>Sept 2, 2015</h4>

<p>Kegged and carbed.</p>

<h2>What I&rsquo;d do differently</h2>

<ul>
<li>For the lactobacillus starter, there are
<a href="http://www.milkthefunk.com/wiki/Lactobacillus#Starters_and_Pitching_Rate">experiments</a>
which show using a bit of apple juice yield a more appropriate environment for
lacto. Further, I&rsquo;ll add some yeast nutrients which I didn&rsquo;t do this time.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;d do more research on appropriate water profile, although it seems to me
chloride and sulfate won&rsquo;t play a big role in a sour beer like this. I might
consider simply using acidulated malt and phophoric acid to tune in on an
appropriate mash pH.</li>
<li>I boiled for a full 60 minutes, but I don&rsquo;t see any reason to having done
that. Next time, a 15 minute wort with the remaining ingredients might be
enough.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ll add &ldquo;test pH meter&rdquo; to my pre-brewing flight check.</li>
<li>Bring the worth pH down to 4.5 before pitching lacto helps with head
retention, so give that a shot as well.</li>
</ul>

    <id>http://www.flyinghopmachine.com/blog/2015/07/25/brew-day-bourbon-barrel-imperial-stout</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I started thinking about the holidays at year-end and wanted to brew something
that is a bit heavier and delicious for the colder weather. I decided to go
with an imperial stout. A beer like this needs to be let to sit for a few
months to let it peak, which means it&rsquo;s time to brew it now. I plan on transfering
this beer to secondary or a keg in about three weeks and let it mature there until
late November.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>Providing a nice Bourbon Barrel character is easy at a homebrew scale. Just
soak some oak cubes in your favorite burbon for a few days, the oaks absorb the
liquor like sponges.  Then place them in a hop bag and add them to the beer.
This has worked for me before, but there&rsquo;s no reason adding plain oaks to the
beer and blending the spirit directly wouldn&rsquo;t work as well. Soaking them in
bourbon first is convenient however, as it helps sanitize the oak cubes and so
it&rsquo;s not necessary to boil them before use.</p>

<p>For this beer I&rsquo;m looking for something bold, with lots of the characteristic
stout roasted malt character, smokey and coffee notes, not too sweet, full
bodied and lots of alcohol. I wanted the base malt to have some character to
it, and considered Maris Otter or other british malts. I also wanted to include
some rye to go with the bourbon theme, so ended up adding some flaked rye, which
should also aid with head stabilization.</p>

<p><em>Water</em></p>

<p>For this beer, I simply used tap water from my area which has a very high
alkalinity as calcium carbonate and usually plays well with dark beers. The
only water adjustments done were a campden tablet to remove chlorine, and
&frac12; a teaspoon of Calcium Chloride in the boil kettle, enough to have a higher
chloride to sulfate ratio.</p>

<h2>Brew notes</h2>

<h4>July 25, 2015</h4>

<p>I collected 11 gallons of tap water, crushed a campden tablet and added it to the water. Ensured it dissolved completely. I transfered 6 and &frac14; gallons to my HLT and heated it up to 165F. Doughed in and mash started with a temperature of 151F.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hgmnz/20002837585/in/album-72157655784368350/" title="Untitled"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3676/20002837585_566b7ec8b5_z.jpg" width="480" height="640" alt="Untitled"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Slowly sparged with the rest of the water. Sparge took a full hour.</p>

<p>Added &frac12; teaspoon of Calcium Chloride to wort in kettle and turned on the burner.</p>

<p>Waited 10 minutes for hot break, and started the 60m countdown. Followed hop and other kettle additions.</p>

<p>Once the hour was complete, chilled wort to 70F and started aerating. Aerated for 45m, and pitched starter. Stirrer bar dropped into beer, woops!</p>

<p>Measured OG was 1.085.</p>

<p>Pitched the starter. Set up a blowoff tube right away, I expect aggressive fermentation.</p>

<p>This fermentation started <em>fast</em>. It had a lag time of just three hours.</p>

<h4>August 8, 2015</h4>

<p>Racked to secondary.</p>
