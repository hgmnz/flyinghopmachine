    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When brewing light colored beers such as Saisons, Blonde Ales, Pale Ales or
IPAs, I like starting off with Reverse Osmosis (RO) water and controlling the
water profile for an appropriate mash pH and for flavor using a few additions
such as Calcium Chloride and gypsum salts as well as food grade Phosphoric
Acid.</p>

<p>RO Water is meant to serve as a great baseline for your additions, beceause it
is stripped out of most minerals, providing the brewer with a blank canvas to
build the water profile for the beer being brewed.</p>

<p>However, today, I was faced with a disturbing inconsistency that threw off my
numbers and assumptions. Here&rsquo;s the story.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>I always measure my starting water pH. It&rsquo;s become a good process checkpoint
along with many others along the brew. My local RO water has consistently been
in a pH range of 7.0 to 7.2. I use this information when treating my brewing
liquor.</p>

<p>Today, I stuck my pH meter in my liquor tank before heating up the water to get
a baseline, and my meter showed an RO water pH of <strong>5.6</strong>. While strike water
pH has little to do with actual mash pH, a higher pH is definitely required.
The phosphates in the grain react with the water in the mash and lower the pH
reaching a bit of an equilibrium point, so if we&rsquo;re targetting somewhere in
the 5.2 to 5.4 range for a recipe, and the starting water pH is 5.6, and with
roughly zero alkalinity to boot, I&rsquo;d expect the mash pH to dive way under the
5.0 mark.  This would mean that not only is the final beer pH going to be way
too low for style, but also now we&rsquo;re inhibiting enzyme activity and impairing
conversion.  No good.</p>

<p>Of course, my first reaction is that I&rsquo;m doing something wrong. Either my pH
meter needs calibration, or it&rsquo;s flat out broken, the HLT was dirty from a
prior sanitizer solution, or well, this is just some really weird RO water.</p>

<p>I proceeded to recalibrate my pH meter. It was already pretty much spot on as
it read the 4.01 and 7.01 buffering solutions from last week&rsquo;s calibration, but
I thought it&rsquo;d be good to just recalibrate.</p>

<p>I measured again, same number.</p>

<p>I then poured some of the RO water straight out of the jug and into a measuring
cup, to avoid being in contact with the kettle at all, or any other agent that
might affect it&rsquo;s pH for that matter. To my surprise, same reading of 5.6.</p>

<p>At this point I&rsquo;m thinking my pH meter is broken. I waited another half hour
for my LHBS to open and went over there with a sample of the water to test it
with their meter as well. I&rsquo;m lucky enough that they&rsquo;re just under 10m away.
Surprisingly their meter agreed with my meter, so it&rsquo;s pretty conclusive: This
RO Water is weird.</p>

<p>I have no idea what could&rsquo;ve caused RO water to have such a low pH. Our local
city water has consistently had a pH of about 8.0. RO is just a filtration
system that removes minerals and nasty chlorine/chloramines from the water, so
how would that lower the pH this way? I don&rsquo;t know, but the store might be
hearing from me soon.</p>

<p>I digress though. It&rsquo;s now time to trobleshoot. I have a few options to work
with this water. I could:</p>

<ul>
<li>Add Baking Soda, Bicarbonate (HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-1</sup>) or Calcium
Carbonate (CaCO<sub>3</sub>). This would have the effect of increasing
alkalinity and pH of the water to an appropriate range for my mash, but at
the quantities required might also have an effect on flavor that I&rsquo;d like to
avoid.</li>
<li>Dump the RO water and go straight to my local tap water. My local tap water
has a huge amount of bicarbonates, which makes it suitable for brewing dark
beers such as stouts, and that&rsquo;s what I usually do. But for a pale beer, I&rsquo;d
have to counteract the high alkalinity with a combination of lots of
phosphoric acid, acidulated malt, gypsum and calcium chloride. This would
leave me with a far too minerally tasting water, unsuitable for most pale
brews.</li>
<li>Blend the faux-RO water with my tap water to reach a desired pH range.</li>
</ul>


<p>I ended up going with blending. I slowly added tap water to the base RO water
until it reached a pH of 7.0. This also meant that I was introducing chlorine
into the mix, so I added a campden tablet to remove it. This brought in some
amount of bicarbonates into my brewing liquor, and I adjusted further with
calcium chloride and a bit of gypsum.</p>

<p>At the end, the mash pH got right on the target range at 5.4.</p>

<p>But now you know, don&rsquo;t take anything from granted. Create a habit of checking
your process along the way, and adjust as necessary. It&rsquo;s the best way to make
consistently great beer!</p>

<p>The question does remain: What would cause RO water to have such a low pH? If
you have any thoughts, please share in a comment.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After a couple of years brewing I came across one of the biggest difficulties
in my brewing to date. A bold, in your face, undeniable off-flavor had plagued
my (home) brewhouse. The flavor was medicinal, plastic-like, pool-like and very
completely overruling. I lost three 5 gallon batches of homebrew, and this is
the story of my quest to find out what was the cause.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>I had never had a such a <em>bad</em> batch before then, and by bad I mean bad
process, not bad recipe. I screwed up many a recipes before. The intensity in
this flavor got me chasing a ghost for a few months. During these period, I
brewed these beers:</p>

<ol>
<li>Saison</li>
<li>Rye Smoked Porter</li>
<li>Rye IPA</li>
<li>Rye Smoked Porter (again)</li>
</ol>


<p>In terms of brewing process, I made a few changes before this off-flavor
appeared in my beers: Use a yeast starter, wort aeration with an aquarium pump
and diffusion stone, and using yeast nutrients. These changes were correcting
high-gravity beers which were coming out under-attenuated.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hgmnz/20051861391/in/datetaken/" title="Untitled"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/335/20051861391_b81d51fc13_c.jpg" width="600" height="800" alt="Untitled"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>I first noticed the flavor on the Saison and the Smoked Porter, both of which I
brewed close enough to each other that I didn&rsquo;t know they both had this
issue as they were fermenting.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hgmnz/20050655986/in/datetaken/" title="Untitled"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/458/20050655986_8c2b1e36cd_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="Untitled"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>I brewed the Rye IPA pretty much the day I found out about the off-flavor as
I racked them to kegs, and so I didn&rsquo;t really change anything about my
equipment or process for that brew. I was pretty much sending a batch of wort
to ferment, not knowing if it would have this flavor too. I went on
regardless.</p>

<h2>The quest begins</h2>

<p>First I took the Saison and the Smoked Porter to my awesome LHBS. After tasting
it there I was convinced this was not an easy thing to fix. The advice I got
was to deep clean everything, and to replace racking canes or hoses that might
be suspect.</p>

<p>I chill my wort with a <a href="http://www.blichmannengineering.com/products/therminator">plate chiller</a>,
so the output wort hose for this was suspect, as well as the chiller itself. I
later replaced this hose, as well as my racking cane which had some buildup. It
turns out you can&rsquo;t <em>really</em> clean racking canes well, it&rsquo;s good to replace
these every 6 - 12 months or so depending on how much you brew. I also got a
hose cleaning brush as I noticed some buildup in some hoses as well as in the
in-line <a href="http://www.blichmannengineering.com/products/thrumometer">ThruMometer</a>.</p>

<p>I also took the Saison and the Smoked Porter to my homebrew meetup, which
includes many experienced brewers as well as a BJCP judge. The obvious flavor
was there, everyone agreed, but nobody could tell me definitively where the
flavor came from. I got conflicting advice in that some folks assured me it
wasn&rsquo;t a bacterial or infection induced flavor as those tend to turn beer
acidic. So indeed, the plot thickens.</p>

<p>At this point I brewed a 2 gallon batch with the purpose of isolating the
problem by chilling half of it with my plate chiller, and the othe half in an
ice bath. I made a simple Pale Ale with extract, used some hops I had lying
around and pitched some dry yeast. The entire purpose was not to make great
beer, but rather to see if the chiller, hoses or inline thermometer had
anything to do with it. It produced drinkable beer nevertheless.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hgmnz/20020435262/in/datetaken/" title="Untitled"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/376/20020435262_23bc04f4b6_z.jpg" width="480" height="640" alt="Untitled"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Next up, I kegged my Rye IPA, and I was surprised and relieved that it didn&rsquo;t
have the off-flavor too. This was one of those beers that went fast because it
was so darn delicious!</p>

<p>Confident in the fact that there was nothing wrong with my equipment at this
point, I went on to brew my Rye Smoked Porter again. At this point, I had
deep-cleaned all of my equipment, replaced suspect parts, and knew that it was
clean of any bacteria. After all, the previous Rye IPA brew went just fine, and
so did the experiment extract batch.</p>

<p>This time around, I tried my wort/beer every step of the way, too. No signs of
this flavor on brewday, so pitched my starter yeast, and off to primary
fermentation it goes.</p>

<p>I sampled the fermenting beer 3 days in and it was clean. Five days in, same
thing. I&rsquo;m safe, I thought. I let it ferment all the way, for about 14 days,
and to my surprise the flavor was back when I kegged.</p>

<p>I still carbonated it. Before I poured this batch down the drain, I saved a few
bottles to get more help identifying what&rsquo;s up. I gave a bottle to a local
friendly brewery, <a href="http://www.cleoph.us/">Cleophus Quealy</a>, who also asked me
for the recipe and brewing notes.</p>

<p>Brewing notes included the usual brewday notes, but most notably noted I used
my local tap water, but removed chlorine with campden tablets, something that
I&rsquo;ve done successfuly in brews past.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s what <a href="https://twitter.com/finack">Peter</a> from Cleophus Quealy had to
say:</p>

<p><blockquote><p>Strong antiseptic flavor. The phenols in the smoke are mixing crazy with possibly the chlorine in the water.  I would ditch the campden tables and go to carbon filtering. Pretty hard to diagnose with that strong off flavor. Biggest guess is chlorophenols esp with the smoked malts.</p></blockquote></p>

<h2>ChloroWHAT?</h2>

<p>Yeah, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlorophenol">chlorophenols</a>. These nasty
compounds are formed when phenols bond with chlorine. Phenol production is
evident in some malts and yeasts, notably smoked malts and some yeasts such as
the delicious
<a href="https://www.wyeastlab.com/rw_yeaststrain_detail.cfm?ID=199among">WY3711</a> used
here among many others, but not really on
<a href="http://www.whitelabs.com/yeast/wlp001-california-ale-yeast">WLP001</a> used for
the Rye IPA.</p>

<p>Alright, so this makes sense, but does this mean that campden tablets don&rsquo;t
work? No, it doesn&rsquo;t, and here&rsquo;s the last piece of the puzzle: I started
getting these off-flavors when I changed something about my brewing process,
and the key lies within the yeast starter. I was just using tap water with no
filtration or treatment to brew my starters. Even though we&rsquo;re just talking
less than a couple of liters of water, this seams to fit the bill.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hgmnz/20082280231/in/datetaken/" title="Untitled"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/509/20082280231_bbc6bbbac9_z.jpg" width="480" height="640" alt="Untitled"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve since switched to using RO or carbon-filtered water for my starters, and
haven&rsquo;t had a problem again, even after brewing the same recipes pressumably
containing the same phenol production.</p>

<h2>Lessons and Conclusions</h2>

<ul>
<li>Do not mess with Chlorine. I still trust campden tablets, but carbon
filtration, reverse osmosis and distillation are also effective.</li>
<li>Beware of your yeast starter water! It can ruin a batch or three.</li>
<li>Good cleaning and sanitation practices are crucial. I always thought I did a
good job at this, but in the face of this issue I wasn&rsquo;t <em>sure</em> - there was
always a chance I was messing something up. As a result, I am now even more
thorough about cleaning and sanitation, and going forward an off-flavor will
be less likely to be sanitation related and might lead me to finding the
cause faster.</li>
</ul>
