    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I started thinking about the holidays at year-end and wanted to brew something
that is a bit heavier and delicious for the colder weather. I decided to go
with an imperial stout. A beer like this needs to be let to sit for a few
months to let it peak, which means it&rsquo;s time to brew it now. I plan on transfering
this beer to secondary or a keg in about three weeks and let it mature there until
late November.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>Providing a nice Bourbon Barrel character is easy at a homebrew scale. Just
soak some oak cubes in your favorite burbon for a few days, the oaks absorb the
liquor like sponges.  Then place them in a hop bag and add them to the beer.
This has worked for me before, but there&rsquo;s no reason adding plain oaks to the
beer and blending the spirit directly wouldn&rsquo;t work as well. Soaking them in
bourbon first is convenient however, as it helps sanitize the oak cubes and so
it&rsquo;s not necessary to boil them before use.</p>

<p>For this beer I&rsquo;m looking for something bold, with lots of the characteristic
stout roasted malt character, smokey and coffee notes, not too sweet, full
bodied and lots of alcohol. I wanted the base malt to have some character to
it, and considered Maris Otter or other british malts. I also wanted to include
some rye to go with the bourbon theme, so ended up adding some flaked rye, which
should also aid with head stabilization.</p>

<p>The recipe is the following:</p>

<p><em>Water</em></p>

<p>For this beer, I simply used tap water from my area which has a very high
alkalinity as calcium carbonate and usually plays well with dark beers. The
only water adjustments done were a campden tablet to remove chlorine, and
&frac12; a teaspoon of Calcium Chloride in the boil kettle, enough to have a higher
chloride to sulfate ratio.</p>

<h2>Brew notes</h2>

<h4>July 25, 2015</h4>

<p>I collected 11 gallons of tap water, crushed a campden tablet and added it to the water. Ensured it dissolved completely. I transfered 6 and &frac14; gallons to my HLT and heated it up to 165F. Doughed in and mash started with a temperature of 151F.</p>

<p>Slowly sparged with the rest of the water. Sparge took a full hour.</p>

<p>Added &frac12; teaspoon of Calcium Chloride to wort in kettle and turned on the burner.</p>

<p>Waited 10 minutes for hot break, and started the 60m countdown. Followed hop and other kettle additions.</p>

<p>Once the hour was complete, chilled wort to 70F and started aerating. Aerated for 45m, and pitched starter. Stirrer bar dropped into beer, woops!</p>

<p>Measured OG was 1.085.</p>

<p>Pitched the starter. Set up a blowoff tube right away, I expect aggressive fermentation.</p>

<p>This fermentation started <em>fast</em>. It had a lag time of just three hours.</p>

    <updated>2015-07-03T20:36:43-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.flyinghopmachine.com/blog/2015/07/03/brew-day-independence-saison</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today I brewed a variation on a recipe that I&rsquo;ve worked on for some time. This
beer is being brewed for a special professional event. I&rsquo;ll be given the chance
to talk about the brewing process, and given the audience is engineers and
bio-medical scientists I might dive into water chemistry and focus on that.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>I was asked to bring what I consider to be &ldquo;my best brew.&rdquo; This is of course a
terrible question to ask a brewer, just like a dad doesn&rsquo;t have a favorite
child. Right, right? So instead I thought about who the audience is, what the
environment is like, and what I thought they&rsquo;d like the most. There will be
other homebrewers and there will be a prize for best beer, so let&rsquo;s aim for
that! In this case, I think I&rsquo;ll be pouring beer to engineers who are open to
some experimentation but aren&rsquo;t really familiar with the breadth of flavors that
exist in beer, so I wanted to step a bit outside their comfort area while still
bringing something approachable and very drinkable for many palettes. I had to
stay away from harsh or aggressive flavors, but want it to be exotic enough to
leave an impression. Things like barley wine, double/tripple IPAs, Imperial
stouts, might be a bit too aggressive for this purpose. On the other hand Pale
Ales, Pilseners, or Kölsh might be too safe. I decided to go with a saison that
has enough of an edge to be interesting, but might be familiar in other ways
such as color and hop profile. We&rsquo;ll see how this goes!</p>

<p>This is a beer I&rsquo;ve brewed a lot before and I&rsquo;ve gone through a great deal of
experimentation before arriving at a flavor profile I really loved. I&rsquo;ve gone
through various yeast strains and hop varieties. I particularly love the
introduction of american citrusy hops with the french saison strain, so we&rsquo;ll
be using lots of that.</p>

<p>To play homage to the all-but-the-kitchen-sink tradition of farmhouse ales, I
added just a bit of flaked rye to this recipe. I&rsquo;ve always had some flaked
wheat in there too, yielding an awesome, white long lasting head.</p>

<p>It is still a very light grist, and based on the success of using acidulated
malt in <a href="http://www.flyinghopmachine.com/blog/2015/06/20/brew-day-drink-with-the-flies-ipa-v2/">a recent
brew</a>, I decided to add
some of that here as well.  Unfortunately that didn&rsquo;t turn out very well (read
more below!), so I will be reducing or removing that completely next time I
brew this beer.</p>

<p>The recipe is:</p>

<h2>Brew notes</h2>

<h4>July 3, 2015</h4>

<p>I treaded RO water per the recipe, lowering strike water pH to 6.1. Strike
water was at 162F, and the mash ended up at 146F. I quickly heated up some
water and added it in to raise the temperature to 151F.</p>

<p>Initial reading of the mash pH was 4.9. The acidulated malt present in the
mash, along with the phosphoric acid used, the very little buffering capacity in
my RO water, and the calcium added with the salt treatments, lowered the pH way
too much. <strong>Next time reduce or remove acidulated malt from grist!</strong> To solve
this, I added NaHCO<sub>3</sub> (Baking soda) in half teaspoon increments
until the mash adjusted up to 5.2. I added a total of one teaspoon and the pH
was spot on. Crisis adverted!</p>

<p>I mashed for 90 minutes, and fly-sparged for 40 minutes. I collected 8 gallons
of wort as I expect a lot of loss to the whole hops and the long boiling time.
Fired up the kettle and 17 minutes later I got the hot break. At this
point I started the 90 minute boil.</p>

<p>Had a nice rolling boil for 90 minutes, adding hops and other additions per the
recipe. Ended up with 6.5 gallons in the kettle.</p>

<p>Chilled and collected 5.5 gallons of wort in the fermenter, spot on.</p>

<p>Pitched the yeast starter that I had prepared the previous day, and set it to
ferment at room temperature, about 68F.</p>

<p>Measured OG was 1.065</p>

<h4>July 26, 2015</h4>

<p>Kegged beer and left it at room temperature.
FG was 1.006. ABV is 7.8%</p>

    <updated>2015-06-21T11:47:05-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.flyinghopmachine.com/blog/2015/06/21/brew-day-daddys-belgian-blonde-ale</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today I&rsquo;m brewing something I haven&rsquo;t brewed before: A belgian blonde.</p>

<p>My objectives with this beer are:</p>

<!--more-->


<ul>
<li>Very crisp and clear appearance, should look a like a pilsener with good head.</li>
<li>A bit of a malty and toasty aroma and flavor.</li>
<li>Balanced hop bitterness and a bit of spicy hop aroma.</li>
<li>High gravity and alcohol.</li>
<li>Subtle and complex, easy drinking and delicious.</li>
</ul>


<p>The majority of the grist is belgian pilsener, but I&rsquo;m adding a bit of aromatic
malt to give it that distinct maltness that plays well with the pilsener. It
also has a bit of flaked wheat to aid with head retention and a bit of a creamy
body. I&rsquo;m also adding 2 pounds of light beet sugar from
<a href="http://candisyrup.com">candisyrup.com</a> to contribute some caramelly richness
but also to aid attenuation and get even higher gravity.</p>

<p>For this brew, I&rsquo;m keeping it very classic as it comes to hop schedule. This is
not a hoppy beer, and the hops' contribution should be that of balance and a
bit of spicyness.</p>

<p>The glowing star for this beer is the yeast. I&rsquo;ve had a lot of success with
WLP510 for big belgian brews, and I think it&rsquo;ll fit well with this beer for its
dry, acidic finish and the mild spicy notes it produces.</p>

<p>I plan on letting this one &ldquo;lager&rdquo; in a keg for at least a month before
carbonating to aid with clarification and let the high alcohol fusel flavors
mellow out.</p>

<p>Mash at 151F for 90 minutes.
Boil for 90 minutes to reduce chance of DMS.</p>

<h2>Brew notes</h2>

<h4>June 21</h4>

<p>I Treated RO water per the recipe. This brought strike water pH down to 6.1.
Along with the salt additions, the mash pH was on target, at 5.4.  Didn&rsquo;t have
to treat mash pH at all, even for such a light-colored grist.  The approach of
using phosphoric acid in strike water rather than adding acidulated malt is one
that works well.</p>

<p>I mashed at 151F.</p>

<p>For sparge water, I added 0.5ml of phosphoric acid which brought it down to a
pH of 5.7. This is about the right amount of phosphoric acid to add the sparge
water without overshooting it!</p>

<p><a href="https://instagram.com/p/4NVgr1H2cu/?taken-by=flyinghopmachine">I collected 8 gallons of 1.055 wort</a>.</p>

<p>Fired up the kettle, it started boiling 12 minutes later, and got to the hot
break 4 minutes after that. At this point I started the 90 minute boil.</p>

<p>Added kettle additions per the recipe.</p>

<p>Post-boil volume was 6.3 gallons. Chilled and transfered to fermenter where I
aerated for roughly 40 minutes.</p>

<p>Pitched two vials of WLP510 as I hadn&rsquo;t prepared a starter this time around.
Stored fermenter at room temperature where it will sit for ~2 weeks.</p>

<p>OG was 1.065</p>

<h4>July 12</h4>

<p>Kegged and took <a href="https://instagram.com/p/5DXyEgn2ck/">a gravity reading</a>. Ended
at 1.011. Leaving at room temp until there&rsquo;s space in my keezer.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I recently brewed an IPA using only New Zealand and Australian hop varieties. I
was shooting for a very light colored, clear, crisp, and fruity IPA to enjoy in
the summer. <a href="https://instagram.com/p/4F-drjn2Qs/?taken-by=flyinghopmachine">Here&rsquo;s a
photo</a>. I used a
very simple grain bill consisting of 50/50 domestic 2-row and pilsener malts,
and added a half pound of wheat to aid in head retention.</p>

<p>For hops, I used Waimea, Australian Summer and Nelson Saivan as follows:</p>

<!--more-->


<p>FWH: 1oz Waimea, 1oz Nelson Sauvin<br>
30m: 1 oz Waimea<br>
5m: 1oz Australian Summer, 1oz Waimea<br>
0m: 1oz Nelson Sauvin 1oz Australian Summer<br>
Dry hop for 3 days: 1oz Waimea, 1oz Nelson Sauvin</p>

<p>I was also experimenting with large First Wort Hopping (FWH) additions while
avoiding any bittering additions at all. I was trying to see how much bittering
I could get from FWH alone. It may have been the hops used, or the process
itself, but I didn&rsquo;t really get much bittering from FWH, so that might be a
good technique for extracting a small amount of bittering from hops and
avoiding harsh bitterness. It&rsquo;s hard to tell how much of the flavor and aroma
profile comes from FWH in this beer as it had many other later hop additions.</p>

<p>In any case, it&rsquo;s an easy enough technique that I&rsquo;ll be including in more of my
brews going forward.</p>

<h2>Beer issues</h2>

<p>The resulting beer was OK, but it had some issues that I will address in this
version. Of course some of these are subjective, the brew itself was solid and
people wo try it seem to like it.</p>

<h3>Color and mouth feel</h3>

<p>It didn&rsquo;t have enough of a malt backbone, and honestly it fell a bit flat and
uninteresting. The color was super pale and yellow, which I was going for, but
I think it could use a bit more color, too.</p>

<p>To address this, I&rsquo;m changing the grist by removing the pilsener malt, and
replacing it with more 2-row and some Vienna and Munich malts to layer some
complexity without adding any significant sweetness. I&rsquo;m also adding a bit
of dextrin to increase body.</p>

<h3>Hop aroma</h3>

<p>It could definitely use more hop aroma and bitterness. I&rsquo;m now adding a proper
bittering addition with CTZ, one of my go-to bittering hops for it&rsquo;s high alpha
acid content. I&rsquo;m also pushing more hops to the later additions to get more
flavor out of them, and throwing Galaxy into the mix to get even more of a
tropical and grapefruit aroma and flavor.</p>

<p>In general, I like the direction of this combination of hops though, and that
remains the focus of my &ldquo;Drink with the flies&rdquo;.</p>

<h3>Yeast selection</h3>

<p>It could use a bit more ester production in fermentation, so I am switching
<a href="http://www.whitelabs.com/yeast/wlp001-california-ale-yeast">WLP001</a> with a bit
more flavorful but dry strain,
<a href="http://www.whitelabs.com/yeast/wlp007-dry-english-ale-yeast">WLP007</a>.</p>

<h3>Mash pH</h3>

<p>My mash pH on the last brew was at 5.8 and I corrected it by adding some
phosphoric acid right in the mash cooler. For this brew I&rsquo;ve changed the grist
by adding some Vienna and Munich malts, which are toasted malts that might add
some acidity in the mash, but not quite enough to get it to the 5.4 range. I&rsquo;m
keeping my salt additions as is, but also adding acidulated malt to help lower
the pH to 5.4.</p>

<h2>Brew notes</h2>

<h4>June 20, 2015</h4>

<p>Mash ended up at 146F. Boiled a quart of water and adjusted up to 149.
Mash pH was on target, 5.4.</p>

<p>Sparge water (RO) pH was of 8.0. I added 3ml of phosphoric acid to bring it
down. It was way too much, brought it down to 3.6, so I had to troubleshoot. I
added 2g of more RO water, but the buffering capacity of this water is so low,
it only brought it up to 4.1. I then replaced 1g of this water with tap water,
which has huge alkalinity in my area, and that brought it up to 5.4. I added a
half of a campdem tablet to not screw with cholrine which has given me
<a href="http://www.flyinghopmachine.com/blog/2015/06/20/brew-day-drink-with-the-flies-ipa-v2/">problems</a>
before. Final Sparge water pH was 5.3.</p>

<p>I sparged for 45m and collected 7.6g of wort. Waited for hot break which took
about 10m, and started the 60m hop addition.</p>

<p>At 15 minutes left of the boil, added a whirfloc tablet, something I do with
all my brews.</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t have enough hop bags, was missing one for the steap additions. I
decided to remove the CTZ bag, clean it up, and use that for the steap
addition. I didn&rsquo;t want to risk having too much trub in the kettle, but this
worked well. I removed the CTZ bag 1 minute before the boil was done.</p>

<p>Chilled down to 68 F with a plate chiller. Aerated wort for 40m, pitched my
yeast starter, and attached a blow-off tube right away. I expect this to be an
aggressive fermentation because of gravity and yeast choice.</p>

<p>OG: 1.078. This is Double IPA territory :)</p>

<h4>July 3, 2015</h4>

<p>Kegged beer. Gravity reading was 1.020, but it is still
fermenting. Also added dry hops of 1oz Waimea and 2 oz Nelson Saivon.</p>

<h4>July 6, 2015</h4>

<p>Removed Waimea and Nelson Saivon dry hop bags</p>

<h4>July 9, 2015</h4>

<p>Dry hopped with 2oz Galaxy</p>

<h4>July 13, 2015</h4>

<p>Removed 2oz Galaxy dry hops.
Smells heavily of passionfruit, might as well call it passion IPA! :)
It appears to continue to ferment as it is still generating CO<sub>2</sub>, so
leaving it in keg at room temperature until activity stops.</p>

<h4>July 25, 2015</h4>

<p>FG: 1.012 (resulting in an 8.8% ABV DIPA)
Set it in keezer and began carbonation.</p>

    <id>http://www.flyinghopmachine.com/blog/2015/06/14/what-in-the-world-is-that-off-flavor</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After a couple of years brewing I came across one of the biggest difficulties
in my brewing to date. A bold, in your face, undeniable off-flavor had plagued
my (home) brewhouse. The flavor was medicinal, plastic-like, pool-like and very
completely overruling. I lost three 5 gallon batches of homebrew, and this is
the story of my quest to find out what was the cause.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>I had never had a such a <em>bad</em> batch before then, and by bad I mean bad
process, not bad recipe. I screwed up many a recipes before. The intensity in
this flavor got me chasing a ghost for a few months. During these period, I
brewed these beers:</p>

<ol>
<li>Saison</li>
<li>Rye Smoked Porter</li>
<li>Rye IPA</li>
<li>Rye Smoked Porter (again)</li>
</ol>


<p>In terms of brewing process, I made a few changes before this off-flavor
appeared in my beers: Use a yeast starter, wort aeration with an aquarium pump
and diffusion stone, and using yeast nutrients. These changes were correcting
high-gravity beers which were coming out under-attenuated.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hgmnz/20051861391/in/datetaken/" title="Untitled"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/335/20051861391_b81d51fc13_c.jpg" width="600" height="800" alt="Untitled"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>I first noticed the flavor on the Saison and the Smoked Porter, both of which I
brewed close enough to each other that I didn&rsquo;t know they both had this
issue as they were fermenting.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hgmnz/20050655986/in/datetaken/" title="Untitled"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/458/20050655986_8c2b1e36cd_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="Untitled"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>I brewed the Rye IPA pretty much the day I found out about the off-flavor as
I racked them to kegs, and so I didn&rsquo;t really change anything about my
equipment or process for that brew. I was pretty much sending a batch of wort
to ferment, not knowing if it would have this flavor too. I went on
regardless.</p>

<h2>The quest begins</h2>

<p>First I took the Saison and the Smoked Porter to my awesome LHBS. After tasting
it there I was convinced this was not an easy thing to fix. The advice I got
was to deep clean everything, and to replace racking canes or hoses that might
be suspect.</p>

<p>I chill my wort with a <a href="http://www.blichmannengineering.com/products/therminator">plate chiller</a>,
so the output wort hose for this was suspect, as well as the chiller itself. I
later replaced this hose, as well as my racking cane which had some buildup. It
turns out you can&rsquo;t <em>really</em> clean racking canes well, it&rsquo;s good to replace
these every 6 - 12 months or so depending on how much you brew. I also got a
hose cleaning brush as I noticed some buildup in some hoses as well as in the
in-line <a href="http://www.blichmannengineering.com/products/thrumometer">ThruMometer</a>.</p>

<p>I also took the Saison and the Smoked Porter to my homebrew meetup, which
includes many experienced brewers as well as a BJCP judge. The obvious flavor
was there, everyone agreed, but nobody could tell me definitively where the
flavor came from. I got conflicting advice in that some folks assured me it
wasn&rsquo;t a bacterial or infection induced flavor as those tend to turn beer
acidic. So indeed, the plot thickens.</p>

<p>At this point I brewed a 2 gallon batch with the purpose of isolating the
problem by chilling half of it with my plate chiller, and the othe half in an
ice bath. I made a simple Pale Ale with extract, used some hops I had lying
around and pitched some dry yeast. The entire purpose was not to make great
beer, but rather to see if the chiller, hoses or inline thermometer had
anything to do with it. It produced drinkable beer nevertheless.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hgmnz/20020435262/in/datetaken/" title="Untitled"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/376/20020435262_23bc04f4b6_z.jpg" width="480" height="640" alt="Untitled"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Next up, I kegged my Rye IPA, and I was surprised and relieved that it didn&rsquo;t
have the off-flavor too. This was one of those beers that went fast because it
was so darn delicious!</p>

<p>Confident in the fact that there was nothing wrong with my equipment at this
point, I went on to brew my Rye Smoked Porter again. At this point, I had
deep-cleaned all of my equipment, replaced suspect parts, and knew that it was
clean of any bacteria. After all, the previous Rye IPA brew went just fine, and
so did the experiment extract batch.</p>

<p>This time around, I tried my wort/beer every step of the way, too. No signs of
this flavor on brewday, so pitched my starter yeast, and off to primary
fermentation it goes.</p>

<p>I sampled the fermenting beer 3 days in and it was clean. Five days in, same
thing. I&rsquo;m safe, I thought. I let it ferment all the way, for about 14 days,
and to my surprise the flavor was back when I kegged.</p>

<p>I still carbonated it. Before I poured this batch down the drain, I saved a few
bottles to get more help identifying what&rsquo;s up. I gave a bottle to a local
friendly brewery, <a href="http://www.cleoph.us/">Cleophus Quealy</a>, who also asked me
for the recipe and brewing notes.</p>

<p>Brewing notes included the usual brewday notes, but most notably noted I used
my local tap water, but removed chlorine with campden tablets, something that
I&rsquo;ve done successfuly in brews past.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s what <a href="https://twitter.com/finack">Peter</a> from Cleophus Quealy had to
say:</p>

<blockquote><p>Strong antiseptic flavor. The phenols in the smoke are mixing crazy with possibly the chlorine in the water.  I would ditch the campden tables and go to carbon filtering. Pretty hard to diagnose with that strong off flavor. Biggest guess is chlorophenols esp with the smoked malts.</p></blockquote>


<h2>ChloroWHAT?</h2>

<p>Yeah, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlorophenol">chlorophenols</a>. These nasty
compounds are formed when phenols bond with chlorine. Phenol production is
evident in some malts and yeasts, notably smoked malts and some yeasts such as
the delicious
<a href="https://www.wyeastlab.com/rw_yeaststrain_detail.cfm?ID=199among">WY3711</a> used
here among many others, but not really on
<a href="http://www.whitelabs.com/yeast/wlp001-california-ale-yeast">WLP001</a> used for
the Rye IPA.</p>

<p>Alright, so this makes sense, but does this mean that campden tablets don&rsquo;t
work? No, it doesn&rsquo;t, and here&rsquo;s the last piece of the puzzle: I started
getting these off-flavors when I changed something about my brewing process,
and the key lies within the yeast starter. I was just using tap water with no
filtration or treatment to brew my starters. Even though we&rsquo;re just talking
less than a couple of liters of water, this seams to fit the bill.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hgmnz/20082280231/in/datetaken/" title="Untitled"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/509/20082280231_bbc6bbbac9_z.jpg" width="480" height="640" alt="Untitled"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve since switched to using RO or carbon-filtered water for my starters, and
haven&rsquo;t had a problem again, even after brewing the same recipes pressumably
containing the same phenol production.</p>

<h2>Lessons and Conclusions</h2>

<ul>
<li>Do not mess with Chlorine. I still trust campden tablets, but carbon
filtration, reverse osmosis and distillation are also effective.</li>
<li>Beware of your yeast starter water! It can ruin a batch or three.</li>
<li>Good cleaning and sanitation practices are crucial. I always thought I did a
good job at this, but in the face of this issue I wasn&rsquo;t <em>sure</em> - there was
always a chance I was messing something up. As a result, I am now even more
thorough about cleaning and sanitation, and going forward an off-flavor will
be less likely to be sanitation related and might lead me to finding the
cause faster.</li>
</ul>
